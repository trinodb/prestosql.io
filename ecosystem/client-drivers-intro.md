Client drivers are language-specific wrappers around the [client
protocol]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/current/client/client-protocol.html). They
enable [client application]({{site.baseurl}}/ecosystem/client-application.html)
developers to connect to Trino, submit SQL queries, and receive the results in
the programming or scripting language of choice. Client drivers remove the need
for developers to understand and implement the interactions of the client
protocol and enable collaboration of all developers in a specific ecosystem.
