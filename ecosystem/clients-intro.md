Clients allow you to connect to Trino, submit SQL queries, and receive the
results. Clients can access all [configured data sources in
catalogs]({{site_url}}/ecosystem/index.html#data-sources). Clients are
full-featured applications or libraries and drivers that allow you to connect to
any applications supporting that driver or even your own custom application or
script.

Clients include command line tools, desktop applications, web-based
applications, and software-as-a-service solutions with features such as
interactive SQL query authoring with editors or rich user interfaces for
graphical query creation, query running and result rendering, visualizations
with charts and graphs, reporting, and dashboard creation.

Clients can also process the returned data from Trino and be used for data
pipelines across catalogs, and also from other data sources to Trino catalogs.
