Trino is designed as a query engine for data lakes and data lake houses. A
complete lake or lake house uses numerous components including object storage
systems, table formats, metastores often also called metadata catalogs, file
formats, and other tools.

Configure a catalog with the required Trino connector for the specific data
table format, and configure object storage and metastore to access the data.
With Trino you are ready to use [any supported
client]({{site_url}}/ecosystem/index.html#clients) to query the lake using SQL
and the features of your client.
