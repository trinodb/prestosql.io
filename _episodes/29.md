## Release 364 

Release 364 is just around the corner, here is Manfred's release preview:

* `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW ... RENAME TO`
* A whole bunch of performance improvements
* Elasticsearch connector no longer fails if fields with unsupported types exist
* Hive connector has optimize procedure now!
* Parquet and Avro fixes and improvements

## Concept of the week: What is Trino?

Trino is the project created by Martin Traverso, Dain Sundstrom, David Phillips,
and Eric Hwang in 2012 to replace the 300PB Hive data warehouse at Facebook. The
goal of Trino is to run fast ad-hoc analytics queries over big data file systems
like HDFS and object stores like S3. 

An initially unintended but now characteristic feature of Trino is its ability 
to execute federated queries over various distributed data sources. This
includes, but is not limited to: Accumulo, BigQuery, Apache Cassandra, 
ClickHouse, Druid, Elasticsearch, Google Sheets, Apache Iceberg, Apache Hive, 
JMX, Apache Kafka, Kinesis, Kudu, MongoDB, MySQL, Oracle, Apache Phoenix, 
Apache Pinot, PostgreSQL, Prometheus, Redis, Redshift, SingleStore (MemSQL), 
Microsoft SQL Server. 
 
How does Trino query across everything from data lakes, SQL, and NoSQL databases
at unprecedented speeds? It helps to start by going over Trino's architecture:

</p>

Trino consists of two types of nodes, _coordinator_ and _worker_ nodes. The 
coordinator plans, and schedules the processing of SQL queries. The queries are 
submitted by users directly or with connected SQL reporting tools. The workers 
actually carry out more of the processing by reading the data from the source or
performing various operations within the task(s) they are assigned.

</p>

Trino is able to query over multiple data types by exposing a common interface
called the SPI (Service Provider Interface) that enables the core engine to
treat the interactions with each data source the same. Each connector must then
implement the SPI which includes exposing metadata, statistics, data location, 
and establishing one or more connections with an underlying data source.

Source: <a href="https://trino.io/blog/2021/04/21/the-definitive-guide.html">Trino: The Definitive Guide</a>.
</p>

Many of these interfaces are used in the coordinator during the analysis and 
planning phases. The analyzer, for example, uses the metadata SPI to make sure
the table in the `FROM` clause actually exists in the data source.

</p>

Once a logical query plan is generated, the coordinator then converts this to a
distributed query plan that maps actions into stages that contain tasks to be
run on nodes. Stages model the sequence of events and a directed acyclic graph
(DAG).

</p>

The coordinator then schedules tasks over the worker nodes as efficiently as 
possible, depending on the physical layout and distribution of the data.

Source: <a href="https://trino.io/blog/2021/04/21/the-definitive-guide.html">Trino: The Definitive Guide</a>.
</p>

Data is split and distributed across the worker nodes to provide 
inter-node parallelism.

Source: <a href="https://trino.io/blog/2021/04/21/the-definitive-guide.html">Trino: The Definitive Guide</a>.
</p>

Once this data arrives to the worker node, it is further divided and processed in 
parallel. Workers submit the processed data back to coordinator. Finally, the 
coordinator provides the results of the query to the user.

## PR 8821 Add HTTP/S query event logger

[Pull request 8821]({{site.github_repo_url}}/pull/8821) enables Trino cluster 
owners to log query processing metadata by submitting it to an HTTP endpoint. 
This may be used for usage monitoring and alarming, but it might also be used to
extract analytics on cluster usage, such as tables/column usage metrics.

Query events are serialized to JSON and sent to the provided address over HTTP 
or over HTTPS. Configuration allows selecting which events should be included.

## Question of the week: Does the Hive connector depend on the Hive runtime?

This week's question covers a lot of the confusion around the [Hive
connector]({{site.url}}/docs/current/connector/hive.html). In short, the answer 
is that the Hive runtime is not required. There's more information available in 
the [Intro to the Hive Connector blog]({{site.url}}/blog/2020/10/20/intro-to-hive-connector.html).
