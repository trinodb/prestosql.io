## First recap from Trino Fest 2024

Cole and Manfred chat a bit about Trino Fest last week, mentioning that [all
videos are now available](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFnr63che7waExsD4lWarA3ML4R2HH58A),
and a blog post with slides and more material is coming as well.

## Impression from Trino Contributor Congregation

Manfred and Dain lead the discussions in the congregation. We are excited about
a lot of the follow ups for the project and increased collaboration and
innovation.

## Guest Patrick Pichler

Patrick specializes in providing guidance, designing, and implementing
sustainable data, analytics and AI solutions utilizing open architectures at
Creative Data. He has a long history of working in the data and data platform
space as user, developer, administrator, manager, consultant, and educator.

## PowerBI overview

[Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) is an interactive data visualization
software product suite developed by Microsoft with a primary focus on business
intelligence. We talk about the different available products and features, and
their usage in the community.

## Trino client support options for Power BI

Typically, Power BI relies on ODBC drivers for connecting to specific data
sources. Since there is no open source Trino ODBC driver however, Patrick and
other clever developers have created a [Power BI
client](https://github.com/CreativeDataEU/PowerBITrinoConnector) that connects
to Trino directly via the client REST API - the
[PowerBITrinoConnector](https://github.com/CreativeDataEU/PowerBITrinoConnector).
We discuss the details and limitation of both approaches, look at the source
code, and learn about import and direct query modes.

## Demo

Patrick showcases how to install and use the connector in his demo of Trino and
Power BI.
