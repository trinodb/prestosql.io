## Concept of the month: High availability with Trino

Goldman Sachs uses Trino to reduce last-mile ETL, and provide a unified way of 
accessing data through federated joins. Making a variety of data sets from 
different sources available in one spot for our data science team was a tall 
order. Data must be quickly accessible to data consumers, and systems like Trino
must be reliable for users to trust this singular access point for their data.

In order for analysts and data scientists to use these services, they first need
to trust in the system. It was vital to Goldman Sachs that Trino has high 
availability. In the event of any failure, another Trino cluster is available to
process requests.

### Integrating Trino into the Goldman Sachs internal ecosystem 

Before high availability was a concern, the team had to first integrate Trino to
meet their requirements. This included integrating with internal security 
systems, observability systems, and credential stores. It also meant
adding integration with their governance services that manage cataloguing
services and data discovery engines. Finally, while many of the Trino connectors
that the team intended to use exist, there were many missing features and 
performance enhancements that would lead to a better user experience and more 
adoption. The team has since taken it upon themselves to work on these features
and contribute them back to Trino. We will cover some of these contributions in
the PR segment of this show.

### Achieving scaling and high availability

Once the team had much of Trino running for some initial use cases, the next 
step was to improve support for more simultaneous use cases and highly 
concurrent workloads. The team wanted trust in the system and so as they scaled
the ability to run blue-green deployments, enable resources isolation, and
have highly available clusters through failures became much more pertinant.

### Trino ecosystem at Goldman Sachs

Here is an overview of the Goldman Sachs ecosystem. It showcases the preexisting
services that needed to connect to Trino, the catalogs supported, and the method
in which Goldman Sachs achieves high availability through supporting multiple
clusters in various groups.

</p>

### Dynamic query routing

In order to ensure that all the clusters receive an even distribution the team
created services that enable dynamic query routing across the different cluster
groups.

</p>

### Query routing components

* [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) - open source edge and service proxy
that provides features such as routing, traffic management, load balancing, 
external authorization, rate limiting, and more.

</p>
* Cluster Groups - cluster group is a set of various Trino clusters that can
be assigned traffic by the 
* Cluster Metadata Service - a service that provides the Envoy routers with all
the cluster related configurations
* Router Service
  * Envoy Control Plane - The Envoy Control Plane is an xDs gRPC-based service, 
  that is responsible for providing dynamic configurations to Envoy. 
  * Upstream Cluster Selection - Envoy provides HTTP filters to parse and modify
  both request and response headers. We use a custom Lua filter to parse the 
  request and extract the `x-trino-user` header. Then, we call the router 
  service, which returns the upstream cluster address.

## PR of the month: PR 8956 Add support for external db for schema management in MongoDB connector

This month's [PR of the month](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/8956) comes
from today's guest Siddhant to solve [this issue related to the MongoDB connector](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/8887).

Siddhant created the issue in response to the common problem that MongoDB 
connector users face when they don't have write capability in the Mongo system.
Since MongoDB has no implicit schema, Trino uses a schema definition that is
written to a special MongoDB database. This PR enables users without write access
to create an external location to store their schema to avoid this issue.

Thanks Siddhant for raising this issue, as it's a common issue beginners using
the MongoDB connector face commonly.

## Bonus PR of the month: PR 8202 Metadata for alias in Elasticsearch connector only uses the first mapping

This bonus [PR of the month](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/8202) comes
from another one of today's guests, Suman. It solves multiple issues, meaning 
this feature is in high demand! 

The problem brought up by these issues also have to do with how we are mapping
schemas over NoSQL databases that don't implicitely have a schema. In this case
Elasticsearch stores it's schema in an object called a mapping. This mapping can
be strict or dynamic for various portions of the document that gets inserted.
The object that correlates to a table in Elasticsearch is called an index. To
keep Elasticsearch fast, multiple indexes are created periodically to support a
given document type similar to partitioning in a database. In general, these 
index follow a very common mapping for a given type, but the reality is that 
Elasticsearch allows you to vary from the mapping. Trino currently simplifies
the way this is done by only reading the first mapping and assuming that all
indexes and documents follow this schema. This pull request addresses this issue
by scanning a much larger sample of mappings and merging the schema to handle
any conflicts. It then goes further to cache these merged mappings for a given
amount of time.

Thanks for all of your continued work on this Suman! It will help a lot!

## Demo of the month: Trino Fiddle: A tool for easy online testing and sharing of Trino SQL problems and their solutions

This months demo showcases a tool that Brian modified from [SQL Fiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/)
tool called Trino Fiddle. This tool will allow Trino users to share problems
and answer questions that other Trino users are facing.

## Question of the month: Does Trino support CarbonData?

This month's [question of the month](https://www.trinoforum.org/t/142) 
comes from [Mahebub Sayyed](https://www.trinoforum.org/u/masayyed/summary) on 
Trino Forum. Mahebub asks, "Does Trino support CarbonData?"

The answer is a little tricky, but it can be done!

[CarbonData](https://carbondata.apache.org/) currently maintains a connector 
called [carbondata-presto](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.carbondata/carbondata-presto) 
that works with an older version of Trino, version 333 (an io.prestosql version 
[before the rename](https://trino.io/blog/2020/12/27/announcing-trino.html)). 
Someone has already opened [a PR to update this connector to a current Trino version](https://github.com/apache/carbondata/pull/4198) 
that they worked on in the middle of 2021 and hasn't made much progress 
recently.

That being said, you could build and use 
[the Trino version of the connector](https://github.com/czy006/carbondata/tree/trino-358-alpha/integration/trino) 
this person was working on, and see if it works for you. If you are running on a 
version of Trino that is older than 351, you should be able to use the existing 
carbondata-presto connector.

If anyone feels motivated, it would be wonderful if you could help get this 
contributed to the CarbonData project, or even work with them to have it land
in the Trino project!
