## Concept of the episode: The VAST database and data platform

Part database, part data warehouse, part data lake, describing
[VAST](https://vastdata.com/) in one sentence is not the easiest undertaking.
You can talk about features like deep write buffers with underlying flash
columnar storage, the automatic contextual layer added on top of the data, or
the similarity-based global compression that more than makes up for the smaller
columnar chunks and makes it so much faster to find exactly the data you're
looking for.

So what is VAST? It's a state-of-the-art data platform. Why are we talking about
it on the Trino Community Broadcast? A world-class data storage solution still
needs a world-class query engine, and its speed paired with Trino's makes for a
brilliant combination. We're diving into how it works, why it is designed the
way it is, and maybe talk about the really cool [performance
comparison](https://vastdata.com/database#performance-comparison) they have on
their website showcasing Trino as their favorite query engine.

Check out our conversation about the VAST database, VAST data platform, the
Trino connector, internal workings of the system, use case, customers and much
more in the interview.

Also have a look at the [presentation from Jason Russler about VAST from Trino
Summit 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RutbCY8i22Q).
