This is the first episode in a series where we cover the basics and just enough
advanced Kubernetes features and information to understand how to deploy Trino 
on Kubernetes.

## Concept of the week: K8s architecture: Containers, Pods, and kubelets

For this concept of the week, we want to provide you a minimalistic overview of
what you need to know about Kubernetes to deploy Trino to a cluster. 

1. **Why Kubernetes?** Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that allows
   you to indicate how to manage containers declaritively using yaml 
   configuration files. This definition can be tricky to understand if you don't
   have proper context. To make sure nobody is left behind, it is useful to 
   cover what containers are:
    
   - The traditional way to deploy an application is to take the compiled 
   binary of that application and run it directly on computer hardware that has
   an operating system to run the application on it. This works, but has a lot
   of dependency on the underlying hardware and operating system to be 
   functional and requires multiple applications to share the same resources. If
   one of the applications fails and causes any of the shared resources to 
   crash, it could cause all applications to fail on that machine. 
    
   - To remove these dependencies, engineers created virtual machines (VMs) by 
   using a VM manager called the hypervisor that emulate hardware environments 
   to host other operating systems. This is a big step forward as now each 
   application can be isolated, but it comes at a great cost. Each virtual machine
   hosts an entire operating system and is resource intensive and slow.

   - Containers are the newest type of deployment. Containers enable a logical
   isolation of resources while still physically running on shared resources. 
   All resources created in the hardware and operating systems exist on the host
   system. The isolation restricts any interference from other processes. 
   Containers achieve the goals of virtualization without sacrificing much 
   performance or efficiency.

   </p>
   
   - Containerization simplified a trend in service oriented architecture called 
   microservices. Microservices deploy loosely coupled and modular applications
   rather than all-encompassing monolithic applications. With containers, these
   applications can be deployed and scaled up quickly across various virtual and
   physical machines without affecting other applications on the same machine. 
   This is great, but results in new complexities. Some examples are the need 
   for new approaches to monitoring the health of applications, scaling the 
   applications as requests grow and diminish, redeploying crashed applications, 
   and networking the applications together. In summary, all of these activities
   can be considered container orchestration and this is exactly what Kubernetes
   solves!

    Source: https://www.slideshare.net/devopsdaysaustin/continuously-delivering-microservices-in-kubernetes-using-jenkins<br/>
    Here we hae two services that each sit behind a load balancer provided and mapped by the Kuberenets cluster.
   </p>

1. **Kubernetes components and architecture**:

   - Node - The physical machine or VM running a kubelet and container runtime.
   - Control Plane - The container orchestration layer that exposes the API and 
   interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the lifecycle of containers.
   - Cluster - a set of nodes connected to the same control plane.
   - Pod - single instance of an application, the smallest object in kubernetes.

    Source: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/
   </p>

### Kubernetes control plane components:

 - API server that nodes connect with and is the front end for users and 
 administrators of the cluster.
 - etcd keystore is a distributed store containing all data used to manage 
 the cluster
 - Scheduler that distributes work across nodes and assigns newly created 
 containers to nodes
 - Controllers that are the brain behind orchestration and monitors for 
 nodes going down etc...
     
### Kubernetes worker node components:
 - container runtime - underlying runtime used to manage containers 
 - kubelet - agent that checks the health and manages the pods running on the node based on the desired state provided in the PodSpec
 - kube-proxy - network proxy that maintains network rules applied to nodes and allows network access between Pods in a cluster

   You can scale up multiple pods on a single node until the node has no more 
   resources, at which time a new node needs to be added and pod instances are 
   distributed between the nodes. 

1. **So how does this relate to Trino?**

 - Out of the box, Kubernetes can do these key things for Trino.
    - Simple scale up and down (manually tell k8s to start or kill Trino pods).
    - Kubernetes supports failover, meaning that your workers will restart if they die.
 - Advanced jobs that could exist but not currently in open source.
    - Auto-scaling via the [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) 
    and custom metrics.
    - Graceful Shutdowns are hooks that you can add into your cluster that wait 
    to shut down to avoid a failed call to a node that already shut down.

1. **What the heck are helm charts then?**

- Helm is package manager for Kubernetes
- Removes the need for managing lots of Kubernetes related yaml files
- Best way to deploy apps to Kubernetes
- Charts are available for many different applications
- Helm chart for Trino


## PR of the week: PR 11 Merge contributor version of k8s charts with the community version

This weeks [PR of the week](https://github.com/trinodb/charts/pull/11) comes 
from a different repo under the trinodb org, [trinodb/charts](https://github.com/trinodb/charts).
This PR contains the merging from contributor [Valeriano Manassero](https://github.com/valeriano-manassero). 

Valerino maintains a [very useful helm chart](https://github.com/valeriano-manassero/helm-charts/tree/main/valeriano-manassero/trino), 
that started before the Trino org had defined our own community chart. This pull
request effectively is trying to merge some useful features Valeriano added to 
his Trino helm chart so that it can be maintained in the community version.

Valeriano's Trino Helm Chart: <https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/valeriano-manassero/trino>

It hasn't been merged yet but we are really looking forward to seeing this get
merged in. Thanks Valeriano!

## Demo: Running the Trino charts with kubectl

For this weeks demo, you need to install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/),
[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) using the [docker driver](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/docker/),
and [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/). You can find the trino helm 
chart on ArtifactHub at this URL.

https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/trino/trino

First, start your minikube instance.

```
minikube start --driver=docker
```

Now take a quick look at the state of your k8s cluster.
```
kubectl get all
```

Add the template for the different trino catalogs on coordinators and workers.
```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
# Source: trino/templates/configmap-catalog.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: tcb-trino-catalog
  labels:
    app: trino
    chart: trino-0.2.0

    tpch.splits-per-node=4
  tpcds.properties: |
    connector.name=tpcds
    tpcds.splits-per-node=4
EOF
```

Add the template for a single coordinator configuration.
```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
# Source: trino/templates/configmap-coordinator.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap

EOF
```

Add the tcb-trino service definition to run Trino. 
```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
# Source: trino/templates/service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: tcb-trino
  labels:
    app: trino
    chart: trino-0.2.0
    release: tcb
    heritage: Helm
spec:

  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: http
      protocol: TCP
      name: http
  selector:
    app: trino
    release: tcb
    component: coordinator
EOF
```

Add the deployment definition for the service.
```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
# Source: trino/templates/deployment-coordinator.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: tcb-trino-coordinator

        app: trino
        release: tcb
        component: coordinator
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1000
        runAsGroup: 1000
      volumes:
        - name: config-volume
          configMap:
            name: tcb-trino-coordinator
        - name: catalog-volume
          configMap:
            name: tcb-trino-catalog
      imagePullSecrets:
        - name: registry-credentials
      containers:
        - name: trino-coordinator
          image: "trinodb/trino:latest"
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /etc/trino
              name: config-volume
            - mountPath: /etc/trino/catalog
              name: catalog-volume
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 8080
              protocol: TCP
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /v1/info
              port: http
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /v1/info
              port: http
          resources:
            {}
EOF
```

Now check the state of the k8s cluster again.
```
kubectl get all
```

Run the following command to expose the url and port to the localhost system.
```
minikube service tcb-trino --url
```

Clean up all the resources.
```
kubectl delete pod --all
kubectl delete replicaset --all
kubectl delete service tcb-trino
kubectl delete deployment tcb-trino-coordinator
kubectl delete configmap --all
```

Now you can run the same demo using the helm chart which includes all of these
templates out-of-the-box. First add the trino helm chart, check the templates
that are produced by helm, and run the install.
```
# HELM DEMO

helm repo add trino https://trinodb.github.io/charts/

helm template tcb trino/trino --version 0.2.0

helm install tcb trino/trino --version 0.2.0
```

Now that it's installed, run the same command to expose the url of the service.
```
minikube service tcb-trino --url
```

Clean up all the resources.
```
minikube delete
helm repo remove trino
```
