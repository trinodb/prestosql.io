## Mitzu

Mitzu is a warehouse-native product analytics platform that revolutionizes how
companies leverage their product usage data in the data lake.

By directly connecting to Trino, Mitzu eliminates the need for traditional
reverse ETL processes to 3rd party applications such as Amplitude or Mixpanel.
Mitzu enables real-time self-served product analytics on top of the existing
data infrastructure with generated SQL queries.
