## SQL routine competition

Trino 431 finally delivered the long-awaited support for SQL routines. To
celebrate and see what you all come up with, we are running a competition.
[Share your best SQL routine]({% post_url 2023-11-09-routines %}), and win a
reward sponsored by [Starburst](https://starburst.io).

## Call for Java 21 testing

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/logos/java-duke-21.png" width="100px" align="right">

Java 21, the latest LTS release of Java, arrived in September 2023, and we want
to take advantage of the performance improvements, language features, and new
libraries. But to do so, [we need your input and confirmation that everything
works as expected]({% post_url 2023-11-03-java-21 %}).

## Concept of the episode: JDBC driver

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/logos/jdbc-small.png" width="100px" align="right">

[Java Database Connectivity
(JDBC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity) is an
important standard for any JVM-based application, that wants to access a
relational database. Trino ships a JDBC driver that abstracts all the low-level
details of our conversational REST API for client tools and supports various
authentication mechanisms, TLS, and other features. This allows tools like
Coginiti to ignore those details, and work with the community on any
improvements for the benefit of all users.

## Client tool focus on Coginiti

Matthew and Roman are joining us from [Coginiti](https://www.coginiti.co).
Coginiti delivers higher-quality analytics faster. Coginiti provides an
AI-enabled enterprise data workspace that integrates modular development,
version control, and data quality testing throughout the analytic development
lifecycle.

</a>

With support for Trino, Coginiti as a client tool provides access to all the
configured catalogs in Trino. It enables data engineers and analyst to work
together in a shared platform, reducing duplication in their work, and bringing
"Don't repeat yourself (DRY)" to analysts.

We talk about why Coginiti added [support for
Trino](https://www.coginiti.co/databases/trino/). Coginiti is not a compute
platform itself, but access to many platforms enables a "data blender thinking".
So as a user you start caring less about the location and source of the
database, and more about the data itself and how you can mix it together to gain
better insights. Every enterprise has more than one data platform, with
different data warehouses, RDBMSes, and data lakes. Matthew talks about reasons
for this situation,. and how Trino as a partner platform to enables users to
federate across all of these platforms when needed.

## Demo of the episode: Coginiti and Trino

In the demo of Coginiti, Roman and Matthew show some of the features of the tool
that enable code reuse and managing transformations on Trino. A tour through
major aspects of the application gives a good impression on benefits and
supported use cases.
