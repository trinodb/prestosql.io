## Concept of the week: Trino at LinkedIn

The LinkedIn team covers the concept of the week in [this section](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlc84xB-Hfs&t=955s).

## PR of the week: Digging into join queries

Today our PR of the week is from the future ðŸ”®! 
[LinkedIn is currently investigating the issue](https://github.com/jitheshtr/trino/issues/1).
This gives us a chance to talk about the research aspects that go into a PR.

With a view `V` that performs a `UNION ALL` from an old table `O` and a new 
migrated table `N`. For `datepartition` values older than `D` (say 2021-06-05), 
table `O` will be referred for data, while for date equal to or greater than `D`,
data from `N` will be used.

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="50%" height="100%" src="/assets/episode/22/view-old-new-tables.png"/><br/>
</p>

The query in question is:

```
SELECT * FROM V
WHERE x IN (SELECT x2 FROM Z)
AND cast(substring(datepartition,1,10) as date) >= date('2021-06-08')
```

Here, table `Z` has stats available and only have 17 rows in them. While the 
data from view `V` (which is entirely from underlying table `N` for this query) 
has say billions of rows.

This query used to take about 39 seconds to run before our upgrade 
(PrestoSQL-333). After the upgrade (Trino-352) it increased to approximately 
thirty-five minutes.

## Question of the week: How can I query the Hive views from Trino?

We actually covered the answer in [episode 18](/episodes/18.html).

You can use the [Coral](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/coral) 
project that allows for translation between different SQL syntax. For example, 
it processes Hive QL statements and convert them to an internal representation using
[Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/). It then converts the internal
representation to Trino SQL. See [the docs](/docs/current/connector/hive.html#hive-views)
for more details.

</p>

This diagram shows the creation of a Hive view, then shows the sequence of events 
when Trino reads that view.
