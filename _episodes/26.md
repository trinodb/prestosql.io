## Concept of the week: Data discovery and Amundsen

Data discovery is a process that aids in the analysis of data where siloed data 
has been centralized, and it is difficult to find data or overlap between
disparate data sets. Many teams have their own view of the world when it comes 
to the data they need, but they commonly need to reason about how their data 
relates to data outside of their domain. 

There are typically questions about who owns what data to help identify 
individuals responsible for maintaining the standards. Additionally, there are 
also issues around providing documentation around the data, and to identify who 
to call for help if there are issues using the data. This allows analysts to 
discover patterns in the data, and periodically audit the data storage 
practices. Interesting questions also arise around existing policies, and can 
encourage a system of record that act as a shared front end around their data 
policies.

### What is Amundsen?

Amundsen provides data discovery by using ETL processes to scrape metadata from
all of the data sources. It creates a central location to collect all that 
metadata and enables search and other analytics of this metadata. Here's how the
project describes itself on [the Amundsen website](https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/):

> Amundsen is a data discovery and metadata engine for improving the 
> productivity of data analysts, data scientists and engineers when interacting
> with data. It does that today by indexing data resources (tables, dashboards,
> streams, etc.) and powering a page-rank style search based on usage patterns 
> (e.g. highly queried tables show up earlier than less queried tables).

Amundsen has an architecture that interacts primarily with `information_schema`
tables, among other metadata, depending on the data source. In Trino's case, 
[the extractor used](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/blob/main/databuilder/databuilder/extractor/presto_view_metadata_extractor.py) 
connects directly to the Hive metastore database, for Trino views, since 
they're stored there. Physical tables use the [HiveTableMetadataExtractor](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/blob/main/databuilder/databuilder/extractor/hive_table_metadata_extractor.py)
to load these tables into Amundsen. This makes sense since the data is stored in
the Hive table format. For non-Hive use cases, you generally want to bypass
using Trino (for now) and directly connect Amundsen to each data source.

</p>

Amundsen includes an ETL framework called [databuilder](https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/databuilder/)
that runs multiple jobs. Jobs contain an ETL task to extract the metadata and 
load it into the two databases that are central to Amundsen, Neo4j and 
Elasticsearch. Neo4j stores the core metadata that is represented on the UI. 
Elasticsearch enables search over the many fields in the metadata. Ingestion via
ETL follows the following steps:

* Ingest base data to Neo4j.
* Ingest additional data and decorate Neo4j over base data.
* Update Elasticsearch index using Neo4j data.
* Remove stale data.

Each job contains an ETL task. The task must define an extractor and a loader, 
and optionally a translator. You can see example configurations for different
extractors on the website, like the [example for the HiveTableMetadataExtractor](https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/databuilder/#hivetablemetadataextractor).


<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="50%" height="100%" src="/assets/episode/26/amundsen-job.png"/><br/>
</p>

The metadata is modeled using a graph representation in neo4j and optionally
[Apache Atlas](https://atlas.apache.org/#/) to model advanced concepts, such as,
lineage and other relations.

### Amundsen as a subcomponent to data mesh

A new architecture, philosophy, and yes, [buzzword](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buzzword) 
that is gaining momentum is the _data mesh_. While it certainly still not 
concretely defined, it is in the research and development phase. Data mesh is
gaining a lot of attention as a potential alternative to data lakes and data 
warehouses for analytics solutions. 

Data mesh mirrors the philosophy of microservice architecture. It argues that 
data should be defined and maintained by teams responsible for their business 
domain similar to how the responsibility is delegated at the service layer. 
Since not everyone is going to be a data engineer on the domain team, there must
be some consideration for the architecture of such a platform. The author of 
this paradigm, Zhamak Dehghani, lays out 4 principles that characterize a data 
mesh. Below are the principles of a Data mesh. Below the systems that provide 
some or all of the solution for a principle are listed in parentheses.

* Domain-oriented decentralized data ownership and architecture (Trino & Amundsen)
* Data as a product	(Amundsen)
* Self-serve data infrastructure as a platform (Trino)
* Federated computational governance (Amundsen to some extent)

### Stemma

Like with many successful open source projects, there are enterprise products 
that build on and support the open source project. [Stemma](https://www.stemma.ai/) 
is the enterprise company that supports Amundsen. It's founded by Mark and 
others central to the open source project.

## PR of the week: Index Trino views

The [PR (or should we say commit) of the week](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/commit/4cfc55d311ca7bc9b02df26ece3b4bde5eedecd6#diff-1c6e94c4ea77e16625f97d4e029f5611d3f3b10d428ab6038edc0b931df4243c), 
adds the original Trino extractor. As mentioned above this extractor is only
needed for views as the physical tables exist in Hive and are retrieved.

### Call to contribute to Amundsen

If you want to help out, you can consider adding the Trino image similar to 
[this commit completed a while back](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsenfrontendlibrary/commit/4e24bfe1c1cd3c6cf568ee1b3e39580686fafbe6).

## Demo: Extracting metadata from Hive metastore and loading it into Amundsen

There were technical difficulties on the day of broadcasting the show, so the
demo was moved to its own separate video.

<div class="youtube-video-container">
  <iframe width="702" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-mL00FkWd0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

The steps in this demo are adapted from the [Amundsen installation page](https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/installation/).
Clone this repository and navigate to the `trino-getting-started/amundsen` 
directory. For this demo you need at least 3GB of memory allocated to your 
Docker application. 

```
git clone git@github.com:bitsondatadev/trino-getting-started.git

cd amundsen

docker-compose up -d
```

Once all the services are running, clone the Amundsen repository in a separate
terminal. Then navigate to the databuilder folder and install all the 
dependencies:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen.git
cd databuilder
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py install
```
Navigate to MinIO at <http://localhost:9000> to create the `tiny` bucket for the
schema in Trino to map to. In Trino, create a schema and a couple tables in the 
existing `minio` catalog:

```
CREATE SCHEMA minio.tiny
WITH (location = 's3a://tiny/');

CREATE TABLE minio.tiny.customer
WITH (
  format = 'ORC',
  external_location = 's3a://tiny/customer/'
) 
AS SELECT * FROM tpch.tiny.customer;

CREATE TABLE minio.tiny.orders
WITH (
  format = 'ORC',
  external_location = 's3a://tiny/orders/'
) 
AS SELECT * FROM tpch.tiny.orders;
```

Navigate back to the `trino-getting-started/amundsen` directory in the same 
Python virtual environment you just opened. 

```
cd trino-getting-started/amundsen
python3 assets/scripts/sample_trino_data_loader.py
```

View the Amundsen UI at <http://localhost:5000> and try to search test, it 
should return the tables you just created. 

You can verify dummy data has been ingested into Neo4j by visiting <http://localhost:7474/browser/>.
Log in as `neo4j` with the `test` password and run 
`MATCH (n:Table) RETURN n LIMIT 25` in the query box. You should see few tables.

If you have any issues, look at some of the [troubleshooting steps](https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/installation/#troubleshooting)
in the Amundsen installation page.

## Question of the week: Can I add a UDF without restarting Trino?

This weeks question of the week comes in from the Trino Slack from Chen Xuying.

> Is there any way to register [a new user defined function (UDF)](https://trino.io/docs/current/develop/functions.html) 
> and needn't restart coordinator and worker?

Currently, no. In Java, jar files and all the java code is loaded up on start 
time. So in order to load the files on all the worker nodes and coordinator, you
need to restart. There are various ways for UDFs to be implemented in a dynamic
way so we are still looking for a suggestion here. 

One option, as Manfred mentions, would be to load Javascript as a UDF as Java
allows to compile Javascript. This would allow for new functions to be added 
without restart. There may be other ways to acheive and we invite you to
contribute your ideas!
