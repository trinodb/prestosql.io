introduction: |
  Manfred Moser and Cole Bowden are joined by Jan Waś to learn about the new 
  Faker connector and the Datafaker library. You can use it to emulate data that
  does not exist on any storage, can shape it as you need, and then learn real
  SQL, build real reports, and make some real charts -  all with fake data.

## Introducing Jan Waś

Jan, also known as [nineinchnick on GitHub](https://github.com/nineinchnick/),
is a very active Trino contributor with a wide range of his own plugins and
projects. He is subproject maintainer for the Helm charts and the Grafana
plugin, and is heavily involved in GitHub actions setup and numerous other
efforts. Jan resides in Poland. When he is not working on Trino, you can find
him at metal, electronics, and even opera concerts across Europe or at home
playing video games.

## Datafaker, Faker connector, and Trino

We talk about using simulated data from the TPC-H and TPC-DS connectors to learn
SQL and use it for other scenarios such as benchmarking, testing for SQL
support, and validating other connectors and data sources. This leads us to the
limitations of these connectors and how the Faker connector is the next step.

Jan tells us about the Datafaker library and his motivation to create a
connector, and how it eventually landed in Trino itself.

## Demo time

Jan shows us how to configure the connector and then demoes a number of use
cases from learning SQL to populating and testing other data sources.
