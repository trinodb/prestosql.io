## Host

* [Manfred Moser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manfredmoser), Director of Trino
  Community Leadership at [Starburst](https://starburst.io),
  ([@simpligility](https://twitter.com/simpligility))

## Guest

* Lukas Eder, Creator of [jOOQ](https:/jooq.org),
  ([@lukaseder](https://twitter.com/lukaseder))

## Trino releases

[Trino 445](https://trino.io/docs/current/release/release-445.html)

* Add support for time travel queries with the Delta Lake connector.
* Add support for the `REPLACE` modifier as part of a `CREATE TABLE` statement
  with the Delta Lake connector.
* Add support for writing Bloom filters in Parquet files with the Hive connector.
* Add support for dynamic filtering to the MongoDB connector.
* Expand support for function pushdown in the Snowflake connector.

## Lukas Eder and data geekery

[Lukas](https://twitter.com/lukaseder) is recognized as a Java Champion and
well-known as a very active member of the Java community. We chat about his
history and involvement in the community of Java and related open source
projects, and how it lead to [jOOQ and his company data
geekery](https://www.jooq.org/). Lukas also briefly talks about other products.

## jOOQ

jOOQ stands for jOOQ Object Oriented Querying (jOOQ). It generates Java code
from your database, and lets you build type safe SQL queries through its
fluent API.

All editions of jOOQ since the 3.19 release include support for Trino. The
level of support depends on the used catalog and connector, and further
Trino-specific enhancements are in progress.

</a>

In our conversation and demo session with Lukas, we cover all the following
aspects and a few other topics:

* What is jOOQ?
* What motivated the creation of jOOQ?
* Discuss the great reasons for using jOOQ:
  * Database first
  * Typesafe SQL
  * Code generation
  * Active records
  * Multi-tenancy
  * Standardization
  * Query lifecycle
  * Procedures
* How does it compare to ORM system like [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/) or
  others like the old [MyBatis](https://blog.mybatis.org/)
* What databases are supported by jOOQ and commonly used?
* Chat about some customer use cases.
* Supported and required Java versions, fun with upgrades, and experience from customers.
* How Lukas discovered Trino and decided to add support for it.
* Challenges and interesting aspects of supporting different databases
* What is next for jOOQ in general, and Trino support specifically?
* Cool SQL features in Trino that might be suitable for standardization:
  * Higher order functions, partially [already supported in jOOQ](https://www.jooq.org/doc/dev/manual/sql-building/column-expressions/array-functions/)
  * Integration of object-relational database feature, such as nested
    collections with `ARRAY` or `LIST`.
  * Potential introduction of new concepts to SQL, such as `MAP`.
* Complexities from Trino having different catalogs and connectors, and the
  catalog, schema, table hierarchy.

jOOQ resources and further information:

* [Website](https://www.jooq.org/)
* [User group mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/jooq-user)
* [Documentation and other learning resources](https://www.jooq.org/learn/)
