## PR of the week: PR 1905 Add format_number function

The
[PR of the week](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/1905), is a simple but
always useful PR done by maintainer [Yuya Ebihara](https://twitter.com/ebyhr).
This fixes [issue 1878](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/1878) that makes
a nice format for very large numbers that get returned from the query to be
truncated with a value suffix like (B - billion, M - million, K - thousand, 
etc...). Rather than reuse the CLI's 
[FormatUtils](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/blob/master/client/trino-cli/src/main/java/io/trino/cli/FormatUtils.java)
class, which missed various cases, he created 
[his own implementation](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/blob/master/core/trino-main/src/main/java/io/trino/operator/scalar/FormatNumberFunction.java) 
that solves
for those issues. Thanks Yuya!

## Demo: Showing the format_number functionality

Here are the examples we ran in the show.

```
SELECT format_number(DOUBLE '1234.5');

SELECT format_number(DOUBLE '-9223372036854775808');

SELECT format_number(DOUBLE '9223372036854775807');

SELECT format_number(REAL '-999');

SELECT format_number(REAL '999');

SELECT format_number(DECIMAL '-1000');

SELECT format_number(DECIMAL '1000');

SELECT format_number(999999999);

SELECT format_number(1000000000);
```

## Question of the week: How do I search nested objects in Elasticsearch from Trino?

A [question posted to StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67667313) 
asked how to search nested objects using the Elasticsearch connector.

Trino maps a [`nested`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/nested.html) 
object type to a [`ROW`](https://trino.io/docs/current/language/types.html#row)
the same way that it maps a standard 
[object](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/object.html) 
type during a read. The nested designation itself serves no purpose to Trino 
since it only determines how the object is stored in Elasticsearch.
