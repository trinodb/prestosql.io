## Concept of the week: Resurface and the Resurface connector

### What is Resurface?
Resurface is an API system of record, which is a fancy way of saying that 
Resurface is a purpose-built database for API requests and responses. Like a 
weblog or access log, but on steroids because Resurface runs on Trino.

Why do you need a system of record for your APIs? Because otherwise you’re 
guessing about how your APIs are used and attacked, and guessing doesn’t feel 
good. Resurface helps your DevOps and security teams instantly find API 
failures, slowdowns, and attacks -- easily, responsibly, and at scale.

### How Resurface differs from logs & metrics
You probably use system monitoring tools, which tell you about what’s happening 
on your systems. What code is running, what code is slow, and what error codes 
are returned. That’s all great — but it still leaves a big gap between the 
system-level events you can see, and what your API consumers actually see.

Resurface helps you fill this gap with your own API system of record. Now your 
customers, your DevOps team, and your security team all have the same view of 
every transaction, because there is a record of the requests and responses.

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="75%" height="100%" src="/assets/episode/17/resurface-tcb1.png"/><br/>
</p>

The other obvious way to compare Resurface against other tools is to look at the
data model. System monitoring gives you time-series metrics, or timestamped log
messages with a severity and detail string. Resurface gives you all the request
and response data fields, including headers and payloads, in a schema where all
of those fields are discrete and searchable. Plus it adds a bunch of helpful
virtual and computed columns.

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="75%" height="100%" src="/assets/episode/17/resurface-tcb2.png"/><br/>
</p>

### The indexing Problem

Resurface has a very descriptive data model, but there’s a problem here -- how
to partition and index this data for efficient searching. Partitioning based on
time is the obvious starting point, but within a time range, what then? Index
everything?

Most databases work best when a subset of the columns are constrained at once --
but in their case, they have strong reasons for wanting to use all columns at 
once. A system monitoring tool might give you a count of “500 codes” -- but they
want to detect silent failures, like malformed JSON payloads or airline tickets 
selling for less than twenty dollars. That means looking at the URL, content 
type, other headers, and payloads, all at the same time.

They also want to classify kinds of API consumers by their behaviors -- are they
using or attacking your API? To classify those behaviors. Again, they look at 
the URL, content type, payloads. If they can query for the yellow region below,
they find lost revenue that they can recover.

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="75%" height="100%" src="/assets/episode/17/resurface-tcb4.png"/><br/>
</p>

Now you might be thinking -- maybe the best solution is to do all this 
processing when the API calls are captured, but then how would you identify a 
new zero-day failure or attack? The definition of “responses failed” and 
“threats” needs to be changeable without having to reprocess any data, which 
really favors query-time processing.

The example below is pretty much as simple as this gets. I struggled to find 
one of these queries that actually fits in a reasonable amount of space.

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="75%" height="100%" src="/assets/episode/17/resurface-tcb5.png"/><br/>
</p>

So how to build a database that does these kinds of queries in reasonable time?

### The Resurface connector

The first prototype actually used the Trino memory connector, which gave them 
the kind of query performance that they were looking for, but wasn’t shippable 
(for obvious reasons).

Then they tried Redis as a replacement in-memory db, but the problem is that the 
queries are gonna pull all the data in Redis over the network for every query.
Not cool.

Trino allows you to move the queries closer to the data, and so that’s what they
did. They took inspiration from the “local file” connector, where the connector
reads directly from the filesystem instead of over the network.

Then the question was, what file format to use?  They tried JSON, CSV, Protocol
Buffers, and ultimately found the fastest and simplest approach was just to
write a simple binary file format that requires no real parsing. When these
files fit in memory, their connector can process SQL queries at 4GB/sec per core. 
The connector was easy to write because they’re just mapping between fields in 
the binary files and the columns exposed to Trino. They built the first version
of their connector in a weekend!

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="75%" height="100%" src="/assets/episode/17/resurface-tcb3.png"/><br/>
</p>

### Why not just use Avro?
* Simple requirements -- basic versioning, no secondary objects, limited data 
 types
* Zero-allocation reader for fast linear scan -- one memcpy per physical column
* Connector can report null/not-null without type conversion
* Connector defers type conversion until getXXX() method
* getSlice() just wraps an existing buffer (zero allocation)

Most of these optimizations were realized by working backwards from the Trino 
connector API to get the best linear scan performance imaginable.

### Combining API calls with other data

Now they can deliver API call data out to all the different kinds of SQL clients 
out there, and they’re also able to combine API call data with data stored in 
other databases.

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="75%" height="100%" src="/assets/episode/17/resurface-tcb6.png"/><br/>
</p>

This is really exciting because your Resurface database plays nicely with all 
your other databases that are bridged together with Trino. That means that 
actual API traffic can be brought into your customer data mart, or combined 
with data from any other systems, in real time!

## PR of the week: PR 4022 Add Soundex function

A big shoutout to [tooptoop4](https://github.com/tooptoop4) for their contribution to this weeks
[PR of the week](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/4022).

This PR adds the [`soundex()` function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex), 
which is a phonetic function. These functions show up in the `WHERE` clause of a
query to find words that sound similar. There's a few examples in the demo
below.

Thanks for this awesome contribution!

## Demo: Using the soundex function

```

SELECT * 
FROM (
  VALUES 
  (1, 'Bri'), 
  (2, 'Bree'), 
  (3, 'Bryan'), 
  (4, 'Brian'), 
  (5, 'Briann'), 
  (6, 'Brianna'), 
  (7, 'Briannas'),
  (8, 'Bri Jan'),  
  (9, 'Bri Yan'),  
  (10, 'Bob')
) names(id, name)
WHERE soundex(name) = soundex('Brian');

# Results:
# |id |name   |
# |---|-------|
# |3  |Bryan  |
# |4  |Brian  |
# |5  |Briann |
# |6  |Brianna|
# |9  |Bri Yan|

SELECT * 
FROM (
  VALUES 
  (1, 'Man'), 
  (2, 'Fred'), 
  (3, 'Manfred'), 
  (4, 'Can fed'), 
  (5, 'Tan bed'), 
  (6, 'Man Fred'), 
  (7, 'Man dread'), 
  (8, 'Bob')
) names(id, name)
WHERE soundex(name) = soundex('Manfred');

# Results:
# |id |name    |
# |---|--------|
# |3  |Manfred |
# |6  |Man Fred|

SELECT * 
FROM (
  VALUES 
  (1, 'Martin'), 
  (2, 'Mar teen'), 
  (3, 'Mar tin'), 
  (4, 'Marteen'), 
  (5, 'Mart in')
) names(id, name)
WHERE soundex(name) = soundex('Martin');

# Results:
# |id |name    |
# |---|--------|
# |1  |Martin  |
# |2  |Mar teen|
# |3  |Mar tin |
# |4  |Marteen |
# |5  |Mart in |

SELECT * 
FROM (
  VALUES 
  (1, 'Robert'), 
  (2, 'Rob'), 
  (3, 'Bob'), 
  (4, 'Bobert'), 
  (5, 'Bobby')
) names(id, name)
WHERE soundex(name) = soundex('Rob');

# Results:
# |id |name|
# |---|----|
# |2  |Rob |


SELECT * 
FROM (
  VALUES 
  (1, 'Christ'), 
  (2, 'Christeen'), 
  (3, 'Christian'), 
  (4, 'Christine'), 
  (5, 'Chris'), 
  (6, 'Kristine')
) names(id, name)
WHERE soundex(name) = soundex('Christine');

# Results:
# |id |name     |
# |---|---------|
# |1  |Christ   |
# |2  |Christeen|
# |3  |Christian|
# |4  |Christine|

# What the results actually return

SELECT name, soundex(name)
FROM (
  VALUES 
  (1, 'Christ'), 
  (2, 'Christeen'), 
  (3, 'Christian'), 
  (4, 'Christine'), 
  (5, 'Chris'), 
  (6, 'Kristine'), 
  (6, 'Christine')
) names(id, name);

# Results:
# |name     |_col1|
# |---------|-----|
# |Christ   |C623 |
# |Christeen|C623 |
# |Christian|C623 |
# |Christine|C623 |
# |Chris    |C620 |
# |Kristine |K623 |

```


## Question of the week: How to export query results into a file (e.g. CTAS, but into a single file)?

This is possible using the [Trino CLI](https://trino.io/docs/current/client/cli.html)'s
`--execute` option in conjunction with the redirect operator (`>`). You may also
use other options, such as, `--output-format` to specify the format of the data
going to the file (e.g. if you want a csv, tsv, json, headers, etc...)

> Output format for batch mode [ALIGNED, VERTICAL, TSV, TSV_HEADER, CSV, 
> CSV_HEADER, CSV_UNQUOTED, CSV_HEADER_UNQUOTED, JSON, NULL] (default: CSV)

Here is an example of the command you would run using the cli executable `trino`.
```
trino --execute "select * from tpch.sf1.customer limit 5" \
--server http://localhost:8080 \
--output-format CSV_HEADER > customer.csv
```

If you're running Trino in Docker, here is an example command to run this in a
temporary Trino container.
```
docker run --rm -ti \
    --network=trino-hdfs3_trino-network \
    --name export-trino-data \
    trinodb/trino:latest \
    trino --execute "select * from tpch.sf1.customer limit 5" \
    --server http://trino-coordinator:8080 \
    --output-format CSV_HEADER > customer.csv
```

If you have a very complex query that takes up multiple lines, or you don't 
want to spend half of your day escaping quotations, you can put your SQL into a
file and reference the query using the `-f` or `--file` options. The query 
above could be represented as this query:

```
trino --file query.sql \
--server http://localhost:8080 \
--output-format CSV_HEADER > customer.csv
```

This query along with the following `query.sql` file produces an equivalent query:
```
select * 
from tpch.sf1.customer 
limit 5;
```

Finally, one last trick is to stage the data using the memory connector to stage
the data and finally export it. The [Trino Definitive Guide](https://www.starburst.io/info/oreilly-trino-guide/) 
has example for adding Iris data set into memory connector storage with CLI.
