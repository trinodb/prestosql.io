## Trino Summit 2021

Get ready for [Trino Summit](https://www.starburst.io/info/trinosummit/), coming
October 21st and 22nd! This annual Trino community event is where we gather 
practitioners that deploy Trino at scale and share their experiences and best 
practices with the rest of the community. While the planning for this event was 
a bit chaotic due to the pandemic, we have made the final decision to host the 
event virtually for the safety of all the attendees. We look forward to seeing
you there, and can't wait to share more information in the coming weeks!
 
## Release 363

Official announcement items from Martin:

* New HTTP event listener plugin
* Insert overwrite for S3-backed tables
* Support for Elasticsearch `scaled_float` type
* Support for Cassandra `tuple` type
* Support for `time` type in MySQL connector
* Support for SQLServer `datetimeoffset` type 

Manfred's additional notes:

* Misc performance and memory usage improvements
* `SHOW ROLES` fix
* `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` fix for estimate display

## Concept of the week: Event stream abstractions and Pravega

### Events and streams

What is an event? This sounds like a silly question when asked generally. The
answer is less clear when discussing event-driven systems though. An **event**
is an action or occurrence that is captured by either a sensor, or a generated
by a source system, and emitted to a sink system. Some examples include user
events from an application, system events in telemetry systems, or sensor events
from monitoring applications.

What is an event stream? Now knowing what an event is, an **event stream** is an 
unbounded set of events that are tracked over time.

In this simple view, an event stream contains a sequential list of events. The
list contains events that have been processed, and some that still need to be 
processed.

</p>

This is very different from a more realistic view of event streams that 
considers that events arrive and are processed in parallel. Event load may also
fluctuate as events may burst around specific events or events have specific 
periodic behavior. While taking event ingest (writes) into consideration, it is
also important to consider event egress (reads) as part of the problem of 
representing event streams.

### Pravega and segments

Engineers at Dell Labs wanted to find a better abstraction to solve for the 
problems they saw in existing event streaming systems. This included how to 
address this type of constant shift in scaling, while also addressing the 
brittle storage abstractions that even streams use today. The storage 
abstraction needs to allow for both real-time and historical analytics. The data
along a particular transaction also needs to be consistent.

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="50%" height="100%" src="/assets/episode/28/segment.png"/><br/>

</p>


Their solution is Pravega. The core of Pravega models streams built around a 
storage unit called a segment. A **segment** is an append-only sequence of bytes
(not events/records). This offers a greater level of flexibility and better 
parallelism and serialization over streams. Pravega stream writers are then able
to write in parallel increasing ingest throughput.

</p>

You can use **routing keys** to map events to particular segments. Pravega
enforces order within specific keys, but does not guarantee ordering of events
across keys. The tradeoff is providing ordering of events versus higher 
parallelism and better performance. 

With segments, you can also scale up and scale down the number of segments 
depending on the workload you're experiencing. Another compelling capability
this enables is managing transactions in the stream. As writers submit data,
they write to a temporary segment, which are merged to a permanent segment on
commit.

</p>

The following diagram displays autoscaling splits and merges as specific routing
keys become more popular. To provide a clearer example, say that the routing 
keys are actually just hash geo location values for a taxi app that are mapped 
between zero and one. As certain locations become crowded, lets say that a lot 
of people are going home for the work day, and many taxis are in the downtown 
location. The locations mapped to the downtown routing keys can automatically 
trigger a split, and once the rush hour is over, it merges these segments as 
traffic slows down.

### Pravega architecture

The Pravega architecture comes with writers groups and reader groups that scale
up and down along with the autoscaling applied to the segments. It consists of
a controller that maintains stream metadata and the segment store that works off
of tier one storage (Apache Bookkeeper) and tier two storage (Object storage).

Just like Trino, Pravega also aims to build a rich set of connectors with
systems that act as a source and sink. This includes a connector used for Trino.

### Pravega compared to other event streaming platforms.

This chart is very helpful resource to summarize Pravega against other popular 
streaming platforms. This comes from the Pravega site so be sure to check for
an up to date list of these features moving forward.

## Demo of the week: Querying Pravega from Trino

This week the Pravega teams demonstrates an example from their [getting-started](https://github.com/pravega/presto-connector/tree/main/getting-started)
tutorial for the Trino connector.

## PR of the week: Pravega presto-connector PR 49

This weeks [PR of the week](https://github.com/pravega/presto-connector/pull/49)
doesn't come from the Trino repository this week but rather the presto-connector
repository. The Trino portion of the repository was committed by Dell engineer 
Karan Singh. As it states, this now makes Pravega available from Trino along 
with the original Presto connector.
            
Thanks Karan for adding Trino and Andrew for writing the original Presto-Pravega
connector!

## Question of the week: What is the point of Trino Forum and what is the relationship to Trino Slack?

Our [question of the week](https://www.trinoforum.org/t/what-is-the-point-of-this-forum-and-what-is-the-relationship-to-trino-slack/28)
comes from the new Trino Forum by Starburst. Brian and a few others at Starburst
created. Slack is a much more adhoc platform for people to work 
through problems rather than to search and find solutions to problems. The Trino
community has such a great amount of knowledge accumulated in this Slack channel,
but there is no way for people to find answers unless they have joined here and 
none of the information we discuss can be found by a search engine like Google. 

Further, a lot of the answers are scattered between different conversations and 
this too can be condensed and simplified. I pondered about the best way for us 
to expose this and though maybe to add an FAQ page on <trino.io> but this would
get stale quickly and this would require a lot of work to be maintained at scale
without a crowdsourcing element. Instead, starting a [Discourse forum](https://www.discourse.org) 
(not to be confused with Discord) acts as a central repository of knowledge 
makes this information easily searchable. The forum is maintained by some of us 
at Starburst but over time we want more moderators from the community (this 
happens through merit and consistency using Discourse Trust levels).
