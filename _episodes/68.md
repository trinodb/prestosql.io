## Releases 

Follow are some highlights of the Trino releases since episode 67:

[Trino 465]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/current/release/release-465.html)

* Add support for customer-provided SSE key in S3 file system relevant for Hive,
  Iceberg, Delta Lake and Hudi connectors.
* Deterministic data, locale support, and `random_string` function for the Faker
  connector.
* Add support for `extra_properties` in the Iceberg connector.
* Add support for the `geometry` type in the PostgreSQL connector.

[Trino 466]({{site.baseurl}}docs/current/release/release-466.html)

* Remove Python requirement for Trino by replacing the `launcher` script.
* Improve client protocol throughput by introducing the spooling protocol and
  ship it with documentation, including implementation in the JDBC driver and
  the CLI.
* Add support for data access control with Apache Ranger, including support for
  column masking, row filtering, and audit logging.

[Trino 467]({{site.baseurl}}docs/current/release/release-467.html)

* Change default for internal communication to HTTP/1.1.
* Add support for OpenTelemetry tracing to the HTTP, Kafka, and MySQL event
  listeners.
* Remove the `microdnf` package manager from the Docker image.
* Add the `$all_manifests` metadata tables in the Iceberg connector.
* Add the `$transactions` metadata table in the Delta Lake connector.

[Trino 468]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/current/release/release-468.html)

* Add [Python user-defined functions]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/current/udf/python.html).
* Rename SQL routines to SQL user-defined functions.
* Add cluster overview to the Preview Web UI. 
* Improve bucket execution for Hive and Iceberg.
* Add support for non-transactional `MERGE` statements for PostgreSQL.

As always, numerous performance improvements, bug fixes, and other features were
added as well.

## User-defined functions in Trino

First there were [custom plugins with user defined
functions]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/current/develop/functions.html), and for a long
time, that was all there is.

In 2023, David contributed SQL user-defined functions, also known as SQL
routines, and we ran a [competition for examples]({% post_url
2023-11-09-routines %}). Manfred wrote the docs and did a [training session with
Dain and Martin]({% post_url 2023-11-29-sql-training-4 %}). And even back then,
David had plans to add other languages, and started working on Python.

At [Trino Summit in 2024]({% post_url 2024-12-18-trino-summit-2024-quick-recap
%}) Martin Traverso announced the new upcoming feature in the keynote, and with
[Trino 468]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/current/release/release-468.html) we shipped
support for [Python user-defined functions]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/current/udf/python.html).

## Motivation

Why support Python for user-defined functions, as compared to just SQL? Simply
put, more is better, and Python is everywhere. We chat with David about the
details.

## Development history and collaboration

David tell us more about figuring out how to make it all work at all. He touches
on topics such as security, performance, deployment, monitoring, and
collaboration with other projects. We also talk about why other approaches like
using local CPython were discarded.

## Architecture and consequences

In this discussion we talk try to cover the following topics:

* How does it all work?
* What are some restrictions?
* What performance can users expect?

Let's chat about this nesting:

## Examples and demo

A simple example from the documentation:

```sql
FUNCTION python_udf_name(input_parameter data_type)
  RETURNS result_data_type
  LANGUAGE PYTHON
  WITH (handler = 'python_function')
  AS $$
  ...
  def python_function(input):
      return ...
  ...
  $$
```

David shows us more, and we talk about the details.

## Feedback and future work

We are looking for feedback:

* More examples for the documentation for our users
* Use cases and experience testing the feature
* Production deployment experiences 

Future work depends on the feedback but definitely includes the following:

* Performance improvements
* Fine-tuning of available Python packages

## Rounding out

* You are all invited to chat with us about development at the Trino contributor
  call on the 23rd of January.
* Join us on the 30th of January with Mateusz Gajewski to learn about client
  protocol improvements.
