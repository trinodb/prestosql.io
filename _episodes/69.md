## Introducing wendigo

What can we say? Top contributor and maintainer, and all around hacker on Trino,

## Main topic

Let's talk about the Trino client protocol. Following are some topics we cover:

* What is the client protocol for?
* History of the client protocol
* Available client drivers and client applications
* Architecture and flow
* Motivation to improve the protocol
* Direct and spooling modes

Cole and Manfred walk through the presentation from and ask a
lot of questions:

## Demo time

Mateusz show us his example and testing setup with Starburst Galaxy clusters
configured for spooling protocol use and shares some of the performance gains he
observes.
