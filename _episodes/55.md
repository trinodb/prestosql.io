## Concept of the episode: Peaka

Another Trino Community Broadcast episode means another cool piece of technology
that uses Trino for us to show off to the community. This time it's Peaka,
a no-code approach to date warehousing that makes it easier than ever to set up
your data stack without needing a ton of complex engineering.

In [their own words](https://www.peaka.com/docs/getting-started/what-is-peaka/),
Peaka is a platform that merges disparate data sources into a single data layer,
letting you join and blend them, query them using SQL or natural language, and 
expose your data to outside users through APIs. Sounds a bit like Trino, right?
That's because underneath the hood, Trino is a key part of how they're making it
happen. In this episode, we talk to the team at Peaka about where they got
started, how they're making it easier than ever to leverage the federation that
Trino is capable of, and the work they've done on top to integrate their
platform with every SaaS data source under the sun.

## Demo of the episode: Using Peaka!

If you want to see what the platform is like, then look no further. We'll be
exploring:

* Connecting to data sources
* Filtering and combining data
* Editing and running queries, including their visual query editor
* Natural language queries
* Visualizing data

## PR of the episode: #18719: Filesystem caching with Alluxio

Perhaps it's a little easier to link to the issue for tracking
[the rollout](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/20550), but however you
want to present it, caching in Trino is renewed! Caching is a huge performance win
for a wide variety of use cases, allowing the engine to run faster, better, and
pump out query results at an unparalleled pace. This is going to lead to 
performance improvements for Trino queries using the supported object storage 
connectors, and you'll hear more from us about it once it's officially launched.
The best part is that there's even more coming down the line as support for it
is expanded.
