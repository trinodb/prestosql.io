## Release 353 -- Almost

353 is right around the corner. Last show we said this would be a small release.
While there was a correctness issue we resolved, there didn't seem to be much
demand to get it out quick as we initially thought. So it was decided to
continue adding more features to 353. It should be coming out shortly!

## Concept of the week: Trino clients, Python, and Apache Superset 

What is the general data flow from a connected data source?

 * Trino workers request data from the data source with specific connector
 * Workers process data and send it to the coordinator
 * Coordinator does final processing
 * Supplies the data via HTTP / REST stream to requestor
 * Requestor is a “client” such as JDBC driver, or Trino CLI
 * Client translates data further and provides to application (Java application
   using JDBC driver) or user interface/directly to user (output in CLI)
 * User views part of data and scrolls down
 * Client requests more data from coordinator via HTTP / REST (and see above)

What clients are provided by Trino project?

 * [JDBC driver](https://trino.io/docs/current/client/jdbc.html)
 * [Trino CLI](https://trino.io/docs/current/client/cli.html)
 * [Trino Python client](https://github.com/trinodb/trino-python-client)
 * [Trino Go client](https://github.com/trinodb/trino-go-client)

What other clients are there?

 * [ODBC driver from Starburst](https://docs.starburst.io/data-consumer/clients/odbc.html)
 * [Various other clients]({{site.url}}/ecosystem/client.html) from the open source community
   * R
   * NodeJS/Javascript

What happens in the Python world?

Disclaimer: I am not a Pythonista or Pythoneer.

 * DB-API 2.0 
   * PEP 249 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>
   * Python standard library
 * trino-python-client 
   * Wraps complexity of Trino HTTP / REST
   * Supports authentication and such
   * Provides DB API endpoints / implementation
   * Preferred method to query Trino
 * SQLAlchemy https://www.sqlalchemy.org/
   * SQL toolkit
   * ORM mapper
   * Widely used, eg. in Apache Superset
   * Supports dialects
 * PyHive
   * Not really a SQL wrapper
   * Aimed at Hive QL
   * Only kind of useful for Trino, limited compatibility
 * JDBC driver (Java !) and PySpark
   * Possible, but a hack really
 * PyJDBC 
   * Wraps DB API around any JDBC driver
   * Kind of a hack since it goes through JDBC to HTTP, when Trino python
   client does the same more directly
 * PyODBC 
   * Similar hack to PyJDBC
 * Potentially also possible to talk to via HTTP directly
   * That’s like reimplementing the trino-python-client
   * Also see question of the week later

Beyond that, it will vary from application to application.

Let’s find out from our guests how this hangs together in Apache Superset, since
it is using Python.

## PR of the week: Superset PR 13105 feat: first step native support Trino

In this week's pull request <https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/13105> that
was graciously added by [dungdm93](https://github.com/dungdm93).

The first thing we need to understand about this addition is the concept of a
database engine in Superset. A database engine handles a lot of the custom
interactions between various databases and maps them to the interface that 
Superset understands. If certain concepts are missing in a certain database, 
like time granularity or SQL syntax, the database engine for that database
indicated to Superset that this is not available. As a result the option does 
not show in Superset, or a concise error message is reported. By default, 
database engines use the [base.py](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs/base.py)
methods, but each engine, like Trino, add the custom mappings with a specific
engine implementation,
[trino.py](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs/trino.py).

The pull request adds a few basic custom changes to enable Trino usage with 
Superset. One change ensures that complex timestamps from Trino are truncated to
a format that Superset is able to support during time aggregation operations.

This opens a vast amount of functionality for using Trino and Superset. We 
wanted to feature this because it goes to show how a small code change, even
one that is not in the Trino repository, can have a vast effect on those
using Superset and Trino.

Thank you so much to [dungdm93](https://github.com/dungdm93) for making this
change and further linking Trino into a fantastic project like [Apache
 Superset](https://superset.apache.org/)!


## Demo: Superset querying Trino to create visualization dashboard

To put this PR to the test, we need to connect Apache Superset to Trino as our
datasource. 

First, you need to follow [these instructions](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/installing-superset-using-docker-compose)
to install Docker (if you don't already have it installed), and then clone the 
Superset repository:

`$ git clone https://github.com/apache/superset.git`

Next, you need to set up the database driver for Trino. Navigate to the root
directory of the local Superset repository you just downloaded and run the
following.

`echo "sqlalchemy-trino" >> ./docker/requirements-local.txt`

This tells Superset scripts to install the sqlalchemy-trino library upon
startup. We know the name by looking up [the Trino driver page](https://superset.apache.org/docs/databases/trino)
for the driver documentation and how to use the connection string. If you were
to install these directly on a Superset node, you would refer to [this database
 drivers page](https://superset.apache.org/docs/databases/installing-database-drivers).

Now run the following command to start up Superset and make sure you're in the 
root folder of the repo.

`docker-compose -f docker-compose-non-dev.yml up`.

After Superset is running, you need to start Trino as well. We did so using a
separate docker-compose app. 

As soon as this is done, you can navigate to Superset's homepage <http://localhost:8088>
and scroll to the **Data** > **Databases** menu. 

Click the **+Database** button.

Set Name to "Trino" and URI to `trino://trino@host.docker.internal:8080`
and click **Add**.

If you want to allow CTAS, CVAS, or DML operations, you'll want to edit
the Database you just created and click on the **SQL LAB SETTINGS** tab and
 select
in the operations you want to allow.

 Connection settings that allows for creation/manipulation of tables.
</p>

You should be able to verify under **SQL Lab** > **SQL Editor** and run a SELECT
query.

We cover adding charts and creating a dashboard in the show. We linked some
blogs from [Preset](https://preset.io/) around how to do a lot of this workflow 
in great detail. Find these blogs linked below! Here's a taste of what we
created in Superset with some [BTS On-Time : Reporting Carrier On-Time
 Performance (1987-present)](https://transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FGJ)
and [Covid Cases](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf) 
reported by the CDC.

## Question of the week: How do I use the Trino REST api?

I want to just use the REST API of Trino. Where is the documentation? How do I do that?

### The short answer:

Don’t do that. Use a Trino client instead. 

### The long answer:

The typical desired use case for using the REST API is to run a query and get 
the result. However that part of the API is not really a traditional REST API 
(HTTP POST, HTTP GET). That just doesn’t work for large datasets to be returned.
Instead, it is a constant open connection and stream of data and interaction
between client and Trino.

The clients take care of all this complexity and provide it in standard API for
the various platforms (JDBC, …). Use the clients!

And if there is no client, or the existing client is not good enough. Create an
open source one or contribute improvements.

### The exception:

There are other simple, pure REST API endpoints that you can use just straight
out of the box. Try <http://localhost:8080/v1/info> or 
<http://localhost:8080/v1/status>.
You could use those for a liveness/readiness probe in k8s or for cluster status
display. By the way, the Web UI uses those and others.. 

### Last note

If you really can’t help yourself, here are some docs.
