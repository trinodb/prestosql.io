## Introducing Peter Kosztolanyi

[Peter Kosztolanyi](https://github.com/koszti) is the Analytics Platform Lead at
[Wise](https://wise.com/) and he [presented about their data
lake](https://youtu.be/K5RmYtbeXAc) with Abdullah Alkhawatrah at [Trino Summit
2024]({% post_url 2024-12-18-trino-summit-2024-quick-recap %}). Peter has a lot
of experience in the data and business intelligence fields.

He also contributes to the Trino Python client, and worked on his own phone and
messaging app for iOS and Android in the past. 

## Trino legacy web UI 

The [existing main web UI for
Trino]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/current/admin/web-interface.html) has been around
for a long time, and sees very limited development and maintenance. It lacks
documentation, a modern look, a clean codebase, and is inconsistent across
screens. It is also very technical and developer focussed, and lacks features
like a SQL console to run queries.

## Efforts for a new UI

While we all knew about the problems of the old UI, nobody with enough UI coding
knowledge or time and motivation ever took up the banner to change the
situation. We did however get a great new UI contributed in Trino Gateway, and
that motivated some people in the community, especially Peter.

Peter started with the same stack, pulled in maintainers like Mateusz Gajewski
and Manfred Moser, and kept working on improvements. We talk more about the
following aspects:

* Problems with the old UI and its technology stack
* Trino Gateway UI
* [Roadmap issue](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/22697) and discussion around the new UI
* What is the stack now?
* Look at the
  [codebase](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/tree/master/core/trino-web-ui),
  tools, development, and
  [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/current/admin/preview-web-interface.html)
* Current status and next steps
* What do we need from others?

## Demo time

Peter shows us the new UI from his development setup - the latest and greatest
set of features.
