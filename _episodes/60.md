## Impressions from the Iceberg Summit

Last week, Cole attended the [Iceberg Summit](https://iceberg-summit.org/) with
a special Trino perspective, and we chat about his impressions and major
take-aways.

## Guest Isa Inalcik from BestSecret

Isa is a highly skilled data expert with over a decade of hands-on experience in
software development lifecycle. He is well versed with many data tools including
Trino/Starburst Enterprise Platform, Snowflake, Airflow, Apache Spark, Hive,
Apache Iceberg, dbt, and others.

## Trino at BestSecret

At BestSecret, a leading online retailer for fashion and lifestyle in Europe,
Isa spearheads the development of efficient and resilient ELT/ETL pipelines and
the implementation of data and AI-driven solutions. We chat in more details
about their setup and use cases, his solutions, and challenges he is facing.

## Generative AI interest and use cases

Isa has been following the waves of interest in AI and sees the following use
cases related to data and Trino:

* Media (Audio,Video,Image): Extract information out of images.
* Object categorization: Categorize objects on images, videos.
* Data masking: For anonymizing sensitive data from unstructured text.
* Data extraction: To pull structured information from unstructured text.
* Sentiment analysis: For gauging the sentiment of textual data.
* Language detection or translation: For language detection or translating.
* Summarization: To generate concise summaries from lengthy texts.

This inspired him to try an integration of the new emerging LLMs with Trino.

## Trino SPI

Trino uses a service provider interface (SPI) to allow developers to create
plugins for features such as connectors, security integrations and custom
functions. This is crucial for business to implement required functionality and
enabled Isa to work on a plugin to support custom functions that call LLMs.

The OpenAI API specification also allowed him to create one function that can be
used with different LLM backends.

## Proof of concept and demo

We look at the concept and implementation that Isa developed with the following
architecture:

Isa's [trino-ai repository](https://github.com/alaturqua/trino-ai) contains
source code and more details as mentioned in his post on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/isainalcik_trino-trino-llama3-activity-7187411736587587584-e2WW/)
and used in the demo.
