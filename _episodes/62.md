## Guest Vincenzo Cassaro

Vincenzo has been working with data in all its forms, from data modeling to
analytics and ML, since he completed his masters in computer engineering in
Italy. He is joining us from there, more specifically from Sicily, to chat with
us about how he got into computers, learned about Trino, and ended up at Prezi
now.

## About Prezi

[Prezi](https://prezi.com/) probably doesn't need any introduction, but just in
case: Prezi is a popular and powerful platform to create and show engaging
presentations, videos, and infographics.

## A Lakehouse that simply works

With so many different technologies and vendors making proposals, it's easy to
lose track of what truly matters. We chat with Vincenzo Cassaro from Prezi about
how a simple combination of established, maintained, open source technologies
can make a lakehouse that truly works at the scale of a company with 150 million
users.

Check out the [Prezi slide deck for Vincenzo's talk](https://prezi.com/view/P4HYav74ficPkkTAHjXJ/).
