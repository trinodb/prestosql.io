## OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is a widely-used collection of APIs, SDKs, and tools that
instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data such as metrics, logs,
and traces to help you analyze application performance and behavior.

</a>

In our conversation with Matt and David we cover all the following aspects, and
a few other topics:

* What is [OpenTelemetry]({{site.url}}/ecosystem/add-on#opentelemetry)?
* Some basic concepts like [logs, spans, traces](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/observability-primer/)
* How is this related to JMX and system data and other monitoring
* What is [OpenMetrics](https://openmetrics.io/)? How is it related to
  [Prometheus]({{site.url}}/ecosystem/data-source.html#prometheus)?
* What tools can you use with OpenTelemetry? Jaeger, Datadog, ...
* Reasoning to add OpenTelemetry to Trino
* Implementation details
* [Trino documentation]({{site.url}}/docs/current/admin/opentelemetry.html) with
  local example usage with Docker containers for Trino and Jaeger
* Practical experience
* Demo of real world usage with Starburst Galaxy and Datadog
* Bonus topic - JSON-format logging via TCP socket
