## Guest Emily Sunaryo

Emily Sunaryo is a recent UC Berkeley graduate working in the Developer
Relations team at Starburst. She has a passion for both technical development
and also enablement of developer communities. With her degree in Data Science,
she is also interested in learning more about modern approaches to data
analytics and how emerging technologies can drive innovation in this space.

## Trino clients

Trino clients come in many shapes and forms, but all of them allow users to run
SQL queries in Trino and access the results. They all use the Trino client REST
API. To make it easier for developers of these applications, as well as any
custom application, we provide a number of drivers as language-specific
wrappers. These include the JDBC driver, the Python client, the Go client, and
others.

## JavaScript

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/logos/javascript.png">

[Filipe Regadas](https://github.com/regadas) agreed to transfer his
[trino-js-client](https://github.com/trinodb/trino-js-client) project to
trinodb and is now subproject maintainer. We are in the process of getting to a
first release ready to ship. We would love for you to help us!

## Learning about Trino

Emily's journey and bringing it all together. From university and Starburst
internship to the Trino Community Broadcast, and a working demo web application.

## Demo time

Emily talks about her demo web application using React, npm, and various other
libraries and tools to build a data application. The data resides in Trino,
specifically in [Starburst
Galaxy](https://www.starburst.io/platform/starburst-galaxy/) to make the
management easier, and she uses the `trino-js-client` in her application to run
some pretty complex SQL queries again the NYC rideshare data set.

[source code repository](https://github.com/emilysunaryo/trino-js-demo).
