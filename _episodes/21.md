## Guests

 * Amy Chen, Partner Solutions Architect at [dbt Labs (formerly Fishtown Analytics)](https://www.getdbt.com/)
 ([@yuanamychen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuanamychen/))

## Release 359

Martin:

* Row pattern recognition for window functions
* Support for `SET TIME ZONE`
* Support for `timestamp(n)` with precision higher than 3 in MySQL
* ARM64-compatible docker image
* Support for granting `UPDATE` privilege
  
Manfred:

* `SET TIME ZONE` is a feature from our guest Marius from last time!
* ARM64 compatible docker image as well as already existing tar.gz and rpm means usage of Graviton and other ARM64 processors is now available also for Kubernetes users, there are significant cost/performance benefits, try it out
* wow .. this time it took a whole month from 358 to 359
* breaking change - need Java 11.0.11
* more materialized view stuff, and I am working on docs!
* Fix handling of multiple LDAP user bind patterns - for those of us in larger orgs.. 
* network logging in CLI
* rename `connector.name` from `hive-hadoop2` to `hive`

## Question of the week: Can dbt connect to different databases in the same project?

This week we are going a little out of order from our usual sequence on this
show. The question really gets to the heart of the concept of the week. We'll 
cover this first then jump into the concept.

This question was asked on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63002171):

> It seems dbt only works for a single database. If my data is in a different 
> database, will that still work? For example, if my datalake is using delta, 
> but I want to run dbt using Redshift, would dbt still work for this case?

Our guest Victor replied: 

You can use Trino with dbt to connect to multiple databases in the same project.

The GitHub example project [https://github.com/victorcouste/trino-dbt-demo](https://github.com/victorcouste/trino-dbt-demo) 
contains a fully working setup, that you can replicate and adapt to your needs.


## Concept of the week: 

### What is dbt?

dbt is a transformation workflow tool that lets teams quickly and collaboratively 
deploy analytics code, following software engineering best practices like 
modularity, CI/CD, testing, and documentation. It enables anyone who knows SQL 
to build production-grade data pipelines. 

When referring to dbt, it can mean two slightly different things. dbt core is 
the open source framework that provides the SQL compiler and framework to manage
your SQL workflow. You can interact with it via a command line interface. In 
addition, dbtlabs offers the fully managed SaaS product dbt Cloud. You can use 
it to handle all of your dbt projects from development to deployment in a single 
browser based tool. It provides useful features like a full IDE to develop and 
test code, orchestration, logging, and alerting. At the moment, dbt Cloud is not
available for Trino users. 

The framework allows you to check the quality of results, document the lineage, 
manage the changes/versions in the SQL scripts and orchestrate the queries, like
a CI/CD framework but for your data. dbt is not an extract and load tool. The 
focus is on transforming what is already in your data warehouse/data lake.

### Goals of dbt and how that differs from Trino

<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="75%" height="100%" src="/assets/episode/21/dbt-trino-architecture.png"/><br/>
</p>

Trino is the execution SQL engine and dbt is the framework to manage your SQL 
statements. dbt won't execute the SQL itself, rather it pushes all of the 
compute down to the SQL engine. This SQL engine can be Trino, or an engine 
included in the data source like the database itself. Using Trino as the SQL 
execution engine allows you to use the same SQL dialect for all connected data 
sources. This includes data sources that natively do not support SQL like object
storage systems, Kafka, Elasticsearch, and many others.

### Transformation vs ad-hoc joins

Transformations done by dbt are in general used to clean and prepare data for 
analytics purposes. It's often used to go from the raw data to a ready-to-use 
data for reporting and analysis. dbt creates database objects like tables or 
views to be consumed by business users and analytics tools.

On the other hand, even if Trino can also execute SQL to create tables and 
views, these SQL queries are not managed but just executed. Trino doesn't have,
like dbt, all the framework to version, audit, document and orchestrate SQL 
script and execution. Trino is more used to execute SQL SELECT 
statements generated by users or BI tools to analyze data in an interactive way.

### Cases for why you need both

Trino and dbt are complementary when you need to access different sources from
a single SQL query or when you need to run SQL query with good performance on
object storage systems like S3, GCS, ADLS, or HDFS.

It's where Trino can complement dbt, as dbt can only access a single data 
warehouse connection in a SQL query. In dbt there is no way to query multiple 
storage systems at the same time.

Trino is recognized for great performance with object storage/data lake 
processing. With dbt it can transform and prepare data at scale. Trino also 
allows you to run dbt on a traditional, on-premise data warehouse where 
normally dbt only runs on a modern cloud data warehouse like Snowflake, 
BigQuery, or Redshift.

### dbt basics
    
dbtlabs offers a [good tutorial](https://docs.getdbt.com/tutorial/setting-up)
which covers the fundamental topics of dbt for you to learn:

* Project: A directory of SQL and YAML files defined with a single project file.
* Models: A model is a single SQL file where you define your transformations to create a table or a view.
* Profile: To define connections to your data sources.

Then you have other resources like seeds, macros, tests, sources, snapshots.

## Demo: Querying Trino from a dbt project

Victor shows us a demo from 
[his blog post that inspired this episode](https://medium.com/geekculture/trino-dbt-a-match-in-sql-heaven-1df2a3d12b5e).

If you looked at the code, you  may have noticed that the code used an adapter 
called `db-presto-trino`. This adapter derives from the outdated presto naming and is
still there for interaction with legacy Presto clusters. Although it can work
it uses an outdated python client to interact with Trino and there is an open
[issue to create an official `dbt-trino` adapter](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-presto/issues/39) 
that uses the updated [trino-python-client](https://github.com/trinodb/trino-python-client).

If you want to help with this, reach out on the issue itself and join the 
`#db-presto-trino` channel on the dbt Slack.

After the show [Marius Grama](https://twitter.com/findinpath), started [work on
dbt-trino in his own repository](https://github.com/findinpath/dbt-trino).
Thanks for the quick turnaround Marius!

## PR of the week: PR 8283 Externalised destination table cache expiry duration for BigQuery Connector

The [PR of the week](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/8283), was committed 
by Ayush Bilala([Twitter](https://twitter.com/ayushbilala)), ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayush-bilala/)), a Staff Software Engineer at
Walmart Global Tech.

This fixes [issue 8263](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/8236) by adding
a new configuration for the Big Query connector, `bigquery.views-cache-ttl` 
to allow configuring the cache expiration for BigQuery views.

Thanks Ayush!
