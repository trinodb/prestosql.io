## Concept of the week: Row pattern matching and MATCH_RECOGNIZE

The `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` syntax was introduced in the latest SQL specification
of 2016. It is a super powerful tool for analyzing trends in your data. We are
proud to announce that Trino supports this great feature since
[version 356]({{site.url}}/docs/current/release/release-356.html). With
`MATCH_RECOGNIZE`, you can define a pattern using the well-known regular
expression syntax, and match it to a set of rows. Upon finding a matching row
sequence, you can retrieve all kinds of detailed or summary information about
the match, and pass it on to be processed by the subsequent parts of your
query. This is a new level of what a pure SQL statement can do.

For more details, [this blog post]({% post_url 2021-05-19-row_pattern_matching %}) 
gives you a taste of row pattern matching capabilities, and a quick overview of 
the `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` syntax.

Let's look at an example with data similar to the TPCH data. Here is an example, 
and the same goal: detect a "V"-shape of the `price`
values over time for different customers.

```
trino> WITH orders(customer_id, order_date, price) AS (VALUES
    ('cust_1', DATE '2020-05-11', 100),
    ('cust_1', DATE '2020-05-12', 200),
    ('cust_2', DATE '2020-05-13',   8),
    ('cust_1', DATE '2020-05-14', 100),
    ('cust_2', DATE '2020-05-15',   4),
    ('cust_1', DATE '2020-05-16',  50),
    ('cust_1', DATE '2020-05-17', 100),
    ('cust_2', DATE '2020-05-18',   6))
SELECT customer_id, start_price, bottom_price, final_price, start_date, final_date
    FROM orders
        MATCH_RECOGNIZE (
            PARTITION BY customer_id
            ORDER BY order_date
            MEASURES
                START.price AS start_price,
                LAST(DOWN.price) AS bottom_price,
                LAST(UP.price) AS final_price,
                START.order_date AS start_date,
                LAST(UP.order_date) AS final_date
            ONE ROW PER MATCH
            AFTER MATCH SKIP PAST LAST ROW
            PATTERN (START DOWN+ UP+)
            DEFINE
                DOWN AS price < PREV(price),
                UP AS price > PREV(price)
            );

 customer_id | start_price | bottom_price | final_price | start_date | final_date
-------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+------------+------------
 cust_1      |         200 |           50 |         100 | 2020-05-12 | 2020-05-17
 cust_2      |           8 |            4 |           6 | 2020-05-13 | 2020-05-18
(2 rows)
``` 

Two matches are detected, one for `cust_1`, and one for `cust_2`.

The matching algorithm was a collaboration between Martin and Kasia. This 
algorithm [lives in the Matcher class](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/blob/master/core/trino-main/src/main/java/io/trino/operator/window/matcher/Matcher.java).

The *running semantics* is the default both in the `DEFINE` and `MESAURES`
clauses. Note that `FINAL` only applies to the `MEASURES` clause.

To sum up, here's one complex measure expression combining different elements
of the special syntax:

## PR of the week: PR 8348 Document row pattern recognition in window

The [PR of the week](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/8348), is adding 
documentation for applying pattern matching over windows. This is yet another
SQL functionality that Kasia added after getting the patter recognition to work
with `MATCH_RECOGNIZE`.


## Demo: Showing MATCH_RECOGNIZE functionality by example

Here are a few examples that Kasia will be running:

Demo preview:

1. The initial query. That's mostly the same query that's in the blog post, the 
differences being:
  * Usage of a real table instead of a CTE.
  * Additional sort key for consistent ordering
  * Two more measures

    ```
    SELECT custkey, match_no, start_price, bottom_price, final_price, start_date, final_date, classy
                  FROM orders
                      MATCH_RECOGNIZE (
                          PARTITION BY custkey
                          ORDER BY orderdate, orderkey
                          MEASURES
                              START.totalprice AS start_price,
                              LAST(DOWN.totalprice) AS bottom_price,
                              LAST(UP.totalprice) AS final_price,
                              START.orderdate AS start_date,
                              LAST(UP.orderdate) AS final_date,
                              MATCH_NUMBER() AS match_no,
                              CLASSIFIER() AS classy
                          ONE ROW PER MATCH
                          AFTER MATCH SKIP PAST LAST ROW
                          PATTERN (START DOWN+ UP+)
                          DEFINE
                              DOWN AS totalprice < PREV(totalprice),
                              UP AS totalprice > PREV(totalprice)
                          )
    ```

1. The query returns many results (many matches). Wrap it in a `count()` 
aggregation to check how many there are:

    ```
    SELECT count() FROM (SELECT custkey, match_no, start_price, bottom_price, final_price, start_date, final_date, classy
                  FROM orders
                      MATCH_RECOGNIZE (
                          PARTITION BY custkey
                          ORDER BY orderdate, orderkey
                          MEASURES
                              START.totalprice AS start_price,
                              LAST(DOWN.totalprice) AS bottom_price,
                              LAST(UP.totalprice) AS final_price,
                              START.orderdate AS start_date,
                              LAST(UP.orderdate) AS final_date,
                              MATCH_NUMBER() AS match_no,
                              CLASSIFIER() AS classy
                          ONE ROW PER MATCH
                          AFTER MATCH SKIP PAST LAST ROW
                          PATTERN (START DOWN+ UP+)
                          DEFINE
                              DOWN AS totalprice < PREV(totalprice),
                              UP AS totalprice > PREV(totalprice)
                          ))
    ```

1. Modify the `PATTERN` to limit the results. Now searching for a "big V":

    ```
    SELECT count() FROM (SELECT custkey, match_no, start_price, bottom_price, final_price, start_date, final_date, classy
                  FROM orders
                      MATCH_RECOGNIZE (
                          PARTITION BY custkey
                          ORDER BY orderdate, orderkey
                          MEASURES
                              START.totalprice AS start_price,
                              LAST(DOWN.totalprice) AS bottom_price,
                              LAST(UP.totalprice) AS final_price,
                              START.orderdate AS start_date,
                              LAST(UP.orderdate) AS final_date,
                              MATCH_NUMBER() AS match_no,
                              CLASSIFIER() AS classy
                          ONE ROW PER MATCH
                          AFTER MATCH SKIP PAST LAST ROW
                          PATTERN (START DOWN{3,} UP{4,})
                          DEFINE
                              DOWN AS totalprice < PREV(totalprice),
                              UP AS totalprice > PREV(totalprice)
                          ))
    ```

1. Unwrap from `count()` aggregation to see the actual matches:

    ```
    SELECT custkey, match_no, start_price, bottom_price, final_price, start_date, final_date, classy
                  FROM orders
                      MATCH_RECOGNIZE (
                          PARTITION BY custkey
                          ORDER BY orderdate, orderkey
                          MEASURES
                              START.totalprice AS start_price,
                              LAST(DOWN.totalprice) AS bottom_price,
                              LAST(UP.totalprice) AS final_price,
                              START.orderdate AS start_date,
                              LAST(UP.orderdate) AS final_date,
                              MATCH_NUMBER() AS match_no,
                              CLASSIFIER() AS classy
                          ONE ROW PER MATCH
                          AFTER MATCH SKIP PAST LAST ROW
                          PATTERN (START DOWN{3,} UP{4,})
                          DEFINE
                              DOWN AS totalprice < PREV(totalprice),
                              UP AS totalprice > PREV(totalprice)
                          )
    ```

1. Change `AFTER MATCH SKIP PAST LAST ROW` to `AFTER MATCH SKIP TO NEXT ROW` to 
detect overlapping matches:

    ```
    SELECT custkey, match_no, start_price, bottom_price, final_price, start_date, final_date, classy
                  FROM orders
                      MATCH_RECOGNIZE (
                          PARTITION BY custkey
                          ORDER BY orderdate, orderkey
                          MEASURES
                              START.totalprice AS start_price,
                              LAST(DOWN.totalprice) AS bottom_price,
                              LAST(UP.totalprice) AS final_price,
                              START.orderdate AS start_date,
                              LAST(UP.orderdate) AS final_date,
                              MATCH_NUMBER() AS match_no,
                              CLASSIFIER() AS classy
                          ONE ROW PER MATCH
                          AFTER MATCH SKIP TO NEXT ROW
                          PATTERN (START DOWN{3,} UP{4,})
                          DEFINE
                              DOWN AS totalprice < PREV(totalprice),
                              UP AS totalprice > PREV(totalprice)
                          )
    ```

1. Change `ONE ROW PER MATCH` to `ALL ROWS PER MATCH` (also, revert the previous 
change). Discuss the `classy` column and explain the `running` semantics on the 
example of `final_date` column:

    ```
    SELECT custkey, match_no, start_price, bottom_price, final_price, start_date, final_date, classy
                  FROM orders
                      MATCH_RECOGNIZE (
                          PARTITION BY custkey
                          ORDER BY orderdate, orderkey
                          MEASURES
                              START.totalprice AS start_price,
                              LAST(DOWN.totalprice) AS bottom_price,
                              LAST(UP.totalprice) AS final_price,
                              START.orderdate AS start_date,
                              LAST(UP.orderdate) AS final_date,
                              MATCH_NUMBER() AS match_no,
                              CLASSIFIER() AS classy
                          ALL ROWS PER MATCH
                          AFTER MATCH SKIP PAST LAST ROW
                          PATTERN (START DOWN{3,} UP{4,})
                          DEFINE
                              DOWN AS totalprice < PREV(totalprice),
                              UP AS totalprice > PREV(totalprice)
                          )
    ```

1. Change the semantics of the `final_date` column to `FINAL`:

    ```
    SELECT custkey, match_no, start_price, bottom_price, final_price, start_date, final_date, classy
                  FROM orders
                      MATCH_RECOGNIZE (
                          PARTITION BY custkey
                          ORDER BY orderdate, orderkey
                          MEASURES
                              START.totalprice AS start_price,
                              LAST(DOWN.totalprice) AS bottom_price,
                              LAST(UP.totalprice) AS final_price,
                              START.orderdate AS start_date,
                              FINAL LAST(UP.orderdate) AS final_date,
                              MATCH_NUMBER() AS match_no,
                              CLASSIFIER() AS classy
                          ALL ROWS PER MATCH
                          AFTER MATCH SKIP PAST LAST ROW
                          PATTERN (START DOWN{3,} UP{4,})
                          DEFINE
                              DOWN AS totalprice < PREV(totalprice),
                              UP AS totalprice > PREV(totalprice)
                          )
    ```

## Question of the week: How do you tag a list of rows with custom periodic rules?

A StackOverflow user asked how to tag orders in a table that meet a certain 
criterion that relies on periodicity. There are certainly some complicated and
inefficient SQL queries that you could craft to address these issues. However,
now with `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` it is possible to do this and take advantage of the
efficient matching capabilities that Martin and Kasia have added.

Here is an example orders table represented as a csv table:

```
Create_time, Order_id, person_id, variable_a
'2021-06-01', 1234, 2232, 1
'2021-06-02', 1235, 2232, 0.6
'2021-06-03', 1236, 2232, 0.33
'2021-06-04', 1237, 2232, 0.7
'2021-06-05', 1238, 2232, 0.6
'2021-06-06', 1239, 2232, 0.4
'2021-06-07', 1240, 2232, 0.8
'2021-06-08', 1241, 2232, 0.7
'2021-06-09', 1242, 2232, 0.4
'2021-06-10', 1243, 2232, 0.6
'2021-06-11', 1244, 2232, 0.7
'2021-06-12', 1245, 2232, 0.6
```

The grace period logic will produce the final_hit column as the result of this 
logic:
 * The `is_hit` column equals to 1 if the variable A less than equal to 0.5
 * There is a grace period totaling 4 Orders after the hit, so any hit that 
is within the grace period will be ignored. The resulting row can be called
`final_hit`.

Based on this logic, this is the desired result of the example is:

```
Create_time, Order_id, person_id, variable_a, is_hit, final_hit
'2021-06-01', 1234, 2232, 1, NULL, NULL
'2021-06-02', 1235, 2232, 0.6, NULL, NULL
'2021-06-03', 1236, 2232, 0.33, true, true
'2021-06-04', 1237, 2232, 0.7, NULL, NULL
'2021-06-05', 1238, 2232, 0.6, NULL, NULL
'2021-06-06', 1239, 2232, 0.4, true, NULL
'2021-06-07', 1240, 2232, 0.8, NULL, NULL
'2021-06-08', 1241, 2232, 0.7, NULL, NULL
'2021-06-09', 1242, 2232, 0.4, true, true
'2021-06-10', 1243, 2232, 0.6, NULL, NULL
'2021-06-11', 1244, 2232, 0.7, NULL, NULL

```

To accomplish this with `MATCH_RECOGNIZE`, you can do the following statement, 
which gives us the correct answer:

```
WITH data(Create_time, Order_id, person_id, variable_a) AS (
    VALUES
      (DATE '2021-06-01', 1234, 2232, 1),
      (DATE '2021-06-02', 1235, 2232, 0.6),
      (DATE '2021-06-03', 1236, 2232, 0.33),
      (DATE '2021-06-04', 1237, 2232, 0.7),
      (DATE '2021-06-05', 1238, 2232, 0.6),
      (DATE '2021-06-06', 1239, 2232, 0.4),
      (DATE '2021-06-07', 1240, 2232, 0.8),
      (DATE '2021-06-08', 1241, 2232, 0.7),
      (DATE '2021-06-09', 1242, 2232, 0.4),
      (DATE '2021-06-10', 1243, 2232, 0.6),
      (DATE '2021-06-11', 1244, 2232, 0.7),
      (DATE '2021-06-12', 1245, 2232, 0.6)
)
SELECT Create_time, Order_id, person_id, variable_a, if(variable_a <= 0.5, true, null) is_hit, final_hit
FROM data
   MATCH_RECOGNIZE (
     PARTITION BY person_id
     ORDER BY Create_time
     MEASURES if(classifier() = 'HIT', true, null) AS final_hit
     ALL ROWS PER MATCH WITH UNMATCHED ROWS
     AFTER MATCH SKIP PAST LAST ROW
     PATTERN (HIT G{,4})
     DEFINE /* G -- grace period */
            HIT AS HIT.variable_a <= 0.5
  )
```
