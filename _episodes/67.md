## Introducing Thomas and Exasol

Exasol is a lightning fast, in-memory database for analytics. And this is not
just a marketing slogan. Exasol has been at the top of the TPC-H benchmarks for
a long time now. Thomas tells more about the database and his role.

## Exasol and Trino

Trino and Exasol bridge the gap between extreme performance with in-memory usage
from Exasol, and massive scale from a lakehouse with Trino.

We learn more about Exasol as Thomas guides us through his [presentation about
Exasol and Trino]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/episode/tcb67-exasol.pdf), and take
the opportunity to question him for more details.

The pull request for the Exasol connector has been a long time in the works and
was finally merged for Trino 452. We talk about the motivation, the process,
the results, and the future for the connector.
