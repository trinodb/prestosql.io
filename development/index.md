### Code style

The Trino code base uses consistent style. It is documented [in
the development
instructions](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/blob/master/.github/DEVELOPMENT.md#code-style).
The style is documented for Java code in the [Airlift code style
project](https://github.com/airlift/codestyle), which includes a configuration
file to use with IntelliJ.

For all other languages, it is expected that new code matches the style used for
existing code in that language.
