Trino Fest 2024 is successfully in the books! While over 100 enthusiastic
members of the community gathered in Boston, over 650 virtual attendees joined
us worldwide to learn from our expert speakers as they discussed topics such as
table formats, enhancements and optimizations, and use cases with Trino both
large and small. And now it is your chance to revisit the presentations or catch
up on everything you missed.

## Impressions

Judging from early results from attendee and speaker feedback, everyone enjoyed
the event. Asked about what sessions the audience liked we got answers like

* *They were all very insightful.*
* *All of it, but especially the realtime demos to see speed difference on query
  optimization.*
* and *All of them, nothing was missed!*

Just like some attendees, our speakers travelled from Europe, Asia, and other
places, and enjoyed the event.

* *Thanks for organizing the awesome event and inviting me for the talk!*
* *Was great to finally meet you and we had a great time at Trino Fest!*
* *Thanks for a great event last week. It was a pleasure to meet you all.*

Many of us also [met Commander Bun Bun](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/k-shreya-s_trinofest2024-bigdata-analytics-activity-7209236269774585857-p8-e?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop),
and [we sent greetings to the remote audience as
well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPYpU9Jrrw).

The keynote, the sessions, and all the talk in the hallways confirmed that Trino
continues to thrive and expand in usage. Large companies like [Apple, Microsoft,
LinkedIn, Amazon, and many other users]({{site.url}}/users.html) openly talk
about shipping Trino as part of their products and using it for internal usage
as well. Smaller companies either run Trino themselves or take advantage of
Trino-based products for all their data platform needs. Our sessions for Trino
Fest offered something to learn for everyone.

Ben and Tommy explore how Executive Homes uses Trino's robust suite of
integrations to handle data at a small scale. Instead of petabytes, how about a
handful of gigabytes in several different systems? It's something that Trino is
well-equipped to handle thanks to how well-supported it is in the data
ecosystem, and they explain why.

handle petabytes of logs**
<br>Presented by Arpit Garg from
[FourKites](https://www.fourkites.com/){:target="_blank"}.

With nearly a petabyte of logs being managed at FourKites, it shouldn't be a
huge surprise that they've turned to Trino to handle understanding and analyzing
them. Arpit discusses how they've scaled log ingestion, strategically used S3
with Parquet to minimize storage costs, transformed and extracted those logs at
scale, and leveraged Trino to search and explore the datasets with Superset as a
frontend for visualization.

## What's next

While you are busy catching up, we are still working hard on a recap of the
Trino Contributor Congregation. We also had a lot of great conversations that
lead us to follow up action items such as more pull requests to review, new
contributors to onboard, and more projects to work on.

Make sure you to [join the community on Slack]({{site.url}}/slack.html) to learn
more in the next little while.

Oh, and one last thing...
