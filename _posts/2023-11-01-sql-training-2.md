In the second part of our training series [Learning SQL with Trino from the
experts]({% post_url 2023-09-27-training-series %}) Martin Traverso and I built
on top of the foundational knowledge from the [first training session]({%
post_url 2023-10-18-sql-training-1 %}). We continued to learn more about data
types and working with them, including the important strings, numeric, temporal,
and JSON types.
