It was time for a refresh. A little while ago in April 2021, we announced
the [Trino version of our definitive guide]({{ site.url }}{% post_url
2021-04-21-the-definitive-guide %}). But again, Trino as a project and community
has continued to innovate and grow. Numerous smaller and larger details changed,
and the examples and resources needed to be fixed.

Today, we are happy to announce that after a few months of updates, testing, and
editing, the second edition of __Trino: The Definitive Guide__ is available.

The [new edition of the book from
O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/trino-the-definitive/9781098137229/)
is available in digital formats as well as physical copies. You can find more
information about the book on [our permanent page about
it](/trino-the-definitive-guide.html).

The book is now updated to Trino release 392 for all filenames, installation
methods, commands, names and properties. We addressed all problems that our
readers found and reported to us as well.

We updated to Java 17 usage, added more SQL statements, and added info about
[Python tools like dbt]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2022-09-20-python-progress
%}) and clients like Metabase. We talk about the lakehouse architecture and new
connectors like Iceberg and Delta Lake.
