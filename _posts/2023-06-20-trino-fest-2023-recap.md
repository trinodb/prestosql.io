Last week we held Trino Fest, and it kept us all so busy, we forgot to spend
time chilling by the lakehouse! Great demos, amazing announcements, new plugins,
and use cases reached our active audience. Thanks go to our event host and
organizer [Starburst](https://www.starburst.io/), to our sponsors
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Alluxio](https://www.alluxio.io/), to our
many well-prepared speakers, and to our great live audience. Now you get a
chance to catch up on anything you missed.

In the weeks leading up to the event, we published numerous blog posts, and
racked up great interest in the Trino community and beyond. Over 1100
registrations blew away our numbers from last year. More importantly, during the
two half-days of the event, we had over 560 attendees watching live and
participating in the busy chat.
