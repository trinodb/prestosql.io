Trino Summit is inching closer fast, and we are busy with all the preparation.
Nevertheless, we thought we bring you some more SQL and Trino-related training.
The two live classes from our [SQL basecamps before Trino Summit]({% post_url
2024-10-07-sql-basecamps %}) are now available for you all to enjoy, just in
case you missed it.

In the two classes I teamed up with Dain Sundstrom and Martin Traverso, and
created a interview-style training classes. Hopefully you learned something from
their insights, and my guidance and questions.

Check out the two session recordings and the supporting material:

## Moving supplies

In the first episode **SQL basecamp 1 – Moving supplies** Dain and I discussed
the core concepts of a Trino-powered lakehouse, getting data in and maintaining
the lakehouse.

## Getting ready to summit

The second episode **SQL Basecamp 2 – Getting ready to summit** builds on the
foundation established in episode 1. Martin and I discussed some further details
for lakehouse usage and then looked at structural data types and views.
