Only about ten Trino releases or six months ago, we released [Trino
447]({{site.url}}/docs/current/release/release-447.html) with the requirement to
use Java 22. In recent releases we started to take more and more advantage of
features that are only available with that upgrade. We made some big steps in
terms of performance and talked talked about some of those performance
enhancements around aircompressor in the recent [Trino Community Broadcast
65]({{site.url}}/episodes/65.html).

The Java community runs its release processes on a very predictable schedule -
March and September mean new Java releases. This time it's Java 23, and
Trino will not be left behind. We are upgrading to [use and require Java
23](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/21316) soon!.

## Background and motivation

While the new features and improvements in Java 23 are not as impactful as in
Java 22, we still need to keep pace to take advantage of the improvements and
avoid any problems in the future. Here are the Java Enhancement Proposals that
are [included with Java 23](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/23/):

* [JEP 455:	Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch (Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/455)
* [JEP 466:	Class-File API (Second Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/466)
* [JEP 467:	Markdown Documentation Comments](https://openjdk.org/jeps/467)
* [JEP 469:	Vector API (Eighth Incubator)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/469)
* [JEP 473:	Stream Gatherers (Second Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/473)
* [JEP 471:	Deprecate the Memory-Access Methods in sun.misc.Unsafe for Removal](https://openjdk.org/jeps/471)
* [JEP 474:	ZGC: Generational Mode by Default](https://openjdk.org/jeps/474)
* [JEP 476:	Module Import Declarations (Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/476)
* [JEP 477:	Implicitly Declared Classes and Instance Main Methods (Third Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/477)
* [JEP 480:	Structured Concurrency (Third Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/480)
* [JEP 481:	Scoped Values (Third Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/481)
* [JEP 482:	Flexible Constructor Bodies (Second Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/482)

video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymuv5aUzWu0) or the [three hour long
launch stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG9xKpgwOI4). The [Oracle press
release](https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-releases-java-23-2024-09-17/)
as well as the [community
announcement](https://blogs.oracle.com/java/post/the-arrival-of-java-23) also
bring you a wealth of further information.

Overall our reasoning is unchanged from the [upgrade to 21]({% post_url
2023-11-03-java-21 %}) and the [upgrade to 22]({% post_url 2024-03-13-java-22 %}).
So what are we specifically doing now?

## Current status and plans

Early access binaries have been in use in our continuous integration builds for
months. Java 23 launched today and the various JDK distribution binary packages
will become available shortly. We are executing on the same blueprint as last
time:

* Wait for [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/) binaries.
* Ensure everything works with Java 23.
* Change the container image to use Java 23.
* Cut a release and get community feedback from testing with the container.
* Adjust to any feedback and available improvements for a few releases.
* Switch the requirement for build and runtime to Java 23.
* Cut another release and celebrate.

Timing on all the work depends on obstacles we find on the way and how we
progress with removing them. We use the [Java 23 tracking
issue](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/21316) and the linked issues and
pull requests to manage progress, discuss next steps, and work with the
community.
