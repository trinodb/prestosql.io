We are pleased to announce the upcoming 2022 Trino Summit. The summit is
scheduled as *hybrid* event on the 10th of November 2022, and attendance is
free! You will be able to join us online, or you can make the trip to San
Francisco and meet us at the Commonwealth Club on the downtown waterfront.
Please be aware that spots at the live event are limited, so register soon if
you want to attend. Please also be aware that you need to register regardless of
whether you'll be joining us in-person or online.

If you'd like to share your knowledge and information about Trino usage and give
a talk at this year's Trino Summit, we're putting out a call for speakers. We
will be accepting submissions from now until September 15th, but we recommend
submitting soon, because slots are filling up fast.

We're looking for intermediate to advanced-level talks on a variety of themes.
If you have an interesting story about how you were able to leverage Trino,
found a neat way to extend it with a custom plugin, or swapped to Trino for a
performance win, we'd love to hear about it. We're excited to expand our speaker
lineup with talks from the broader Trino community. If you're interested, you
can check out the speaker registration page for more information.

And of course, we're looking forward to seeing you there, whether in-person or
online!

*Update from 15th September 2022:* The call for speakers is closed. Thank you
for all your submissions.
