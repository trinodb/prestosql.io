Greetings Trino nation,

As mentioned in [last year’s Presto Summit blog](https://blog.starburst.io/presto-summit-sf-postponed-to-2021), 
“It’s not goodbye, it’s see you later!” We may not have guessed at the time that
“later” was a year and a half, but here we are. 

Get ready for this year’s hybrid Trino Summit event! This year’s summit feels a 
little different coming back for many reasons. For one, the name of the event 
has changed from Presto to Trino, which means this will be the first event of 
the project hosted [under the new banner of Trino](https://trino.io/blog/2020/12/27/announcing-trino.html).

New names and cute bunnies aside, this event has a lot of extra excitement as we
ring in the first hybrid in-person and virtual Trino event held since the 
beginning of the pandemic! We're really looking forward to talking in front of a
live audience with the high fives, hugs, and handshakes we’ve all missed for 
over a year.

This year's Summit is hosted by Starburst at [the Commonwealth Club](https://www.commonwealthclub.org/visitorinfo)
in San Francisco, CA on October 13th. We'd originally set the date on 
September 15th but later realized that this was conflicting with Yom Kippur. 
While making these updates, it became clear that we could include more people 
with a hybrid format. If you've already registered, we'll reach out to you with 
updated information and attendance options. 

If you haven’t registered yet, [register here](http://starburst.io/trinosummit2021). 
If you plan to attend in person, for safety purposes, you need to upload a copy
of your vaccine card. If you haven’t received your vaccine but plan to receive 
your final dose two weeks before the date of the conference then you can send us
an email at [events@starburst.io](mailto:events@starburst.io).

Get excited for our great lineup of speakers, panels, and presentations! We're 
always on the lookout for speakers who are excited to share their Trino 
experiences. Check out the [call for papers](https://www.starburst.io/info/trino-summit-call-for-papers/) 
to learn more about how to submit your talk and share your experience with 
fellow Trino lovers!

We look forward to seeing you there or seeing you online.
