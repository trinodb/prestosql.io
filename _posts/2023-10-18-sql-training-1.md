In our training series [Learning SQL with Trino from the experts]({% post_url
2023-09-27-training-series %}) Martin Traverso, Dain Sundstrom, David Phillips,
and myself will run through the wide range of SQL support and features of Trino with
our audience. In the first episode, we covered the concepts of Trino and SQL, and
then started to learn some basic SQL. Now you can take advantage of the
recording and available resources to learn at your own pace.
