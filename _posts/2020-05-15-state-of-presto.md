Presto is continuing to gain adoption across many industries and use cases. Our
community is growing rapidly and there is a lot going on, so we are taking the
Presto Summit online. And we are starting with a State of Presto webinar with
the founders of the project.

Update:

We had a great event with lots of questions from the audience, taking us beyond
the planned time frame. Check out the recording to learn more:
