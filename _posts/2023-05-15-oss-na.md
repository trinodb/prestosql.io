Last week I had the pleasure to attend [Open Source Summit North America
2023](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/) in
Vancouver. A quick hop across the [Strait of
Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Georgia) got my right into the
event and in the midst of my peers of open source developers, advocates, and
enthusiasts.

A highlight of the event for me was catching up with many existing and new
friends from the open source communities. It was also inspiring to learn details
about the success of open source projects and communities, including
[Opensearch](https://opensearch.org/), [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/about/), the
British Columbia government [DevHub project](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/), NASA
[open source](https://code.nasa.gov/) and [open data
projects](https://data.nasa.gov/), and many others.

In my interview with John Furrier and Rob Strechay for [SiliconANGLE
theCUBE](https://www.thecube.net/) I was able to share more information about
Trino, query engines, lakehouses, and [Starburst](starburst.io). We also talked
about the benefits of using Trino for different use cases, how data is
continuing to be crucially important, if not emphasized even more by the new
wave of large language models.

SiliconANGLE theCUBE features [more interview coverage from the
summit](https://www.thecube.net/events/linux-foundation/open-source-summit-na-2023).
and The Linux Foundation [makes keynote and session videos as well as
presentation decks available](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/).

My special thanks goes to Starburst for sending me to represent the Trino
community at the summit. I also really appreciate the help for organizing the
Trino Fest. The speaker proposals are all in, and the free, virtual event is
promising to be a great showcase of Trino, modern lakehouse platforms and tools
from the community of users, contributors and vendors, and our increased
adoption for a wide range of use cases.

Join us in June for the event, you don't want to miss some of the announcements
and demos.
