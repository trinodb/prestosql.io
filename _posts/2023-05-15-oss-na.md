Last week, I had the pleasure to attend [Open Source Summit North America
2023](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/) in
Vancouver. A quick hop across the [Strait of
Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Georgia) got me right into the
event and into the midst of my peers of open source developers, advocates, and
enthusiasts.

A highlight of the event for me was catching up with many existing and new
friends from the open source communities. It was inspiring to learn details
about the success of open source projects, including
[Opensearch](https://opensearch.org/), [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/about/), the
British Columbia government [DevHub project](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/), NASA
[open source](https://code.nasa.gov/) and [open data
projects](https://data.nasa.gov/), and many others.

In my interview with John Furrier and Rob Strechay for [SiliconANGLE
theCUBE](https://www.thecube.net/), I was able to share more information about
Trino, query engines, lakehouses, and [Starburst](https://starburst.io). We also
talked about the benefits of using Trino for different use cases, how data
continues to be crucial, and how it is even important thanks to the new
wave of large language models.

SiliconANGLE theCUBE features [more interview coverage from the
summit](https://www.thecube.net/events/linux-foundation/open-source-summit-na-2023).
and The Linux Foundation [makes keynote and session videos as well as
presentation decks available](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/).

My special thanks goes to Starburst for sending me to represent the Trino
community at the summit. I also really appreciate the help for organizing Trino
Fest. The speaker proposals are all in, and the free, virtual event is promising
to be a great showcase of Trino, modern lakehouse platforms and tools from the
community of users, contributors and vendors, and our increased adoption for a
wide range of use cases.

Join us in June for the event, you don't want to miss some of the announcements
and demos.
