Summer is just around the corner, and we are busy getting ready for [Trino Fest
2023]({% post_url 2023-04-05-announcing-trino-fest-2023 %}). Everything is
ramping up. Early birds are starting to register, and [so should
you](https://www.starburst.io/info/trinofest). Our Trino Fest theme song is
available for your listening pleasure, and we are reviewing speaker submissions.
The festival is promising to be another great event to learn about lakehouse use
cases with Trino, but we are also featuring some great presentations for
querying data with Trino. And of course, we are still looking for more
presenters, so don't hesitate and [submit your
proposal](https://sessionize.com/trino-fest-2023).

Before you dive into the technical details of our upcoming conference, lean back
and listen to our theme song. Hopefully you are feeling the summer vibe coming
your way already.

Our event host [Starburst](https://www.starburst.io/) is again helping us ensure
that Trino Fest is a venue for Trino beginners and experts to meet, exchange
ideas, and learn from each other. One of the Starburst engineers, [Jan
Wa≈õ](https://github.com/nineinchnick), is scheduled to present about his
amazingly low-effort setup to use Trino for data analysis and report generation.

Getting closer to the theme of the event "Lakehouse summer camp", we are
planning to have sessions about Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Hudi usage with Trino.
Learn about the latest  developments from these projects and practical tips and
tricks from the user community.

In the keynote, Martin Traverso will speak about the many new features that
arrived in Trino since [Trino Summit last year]({% post_url
2022-11-21-trino-summit-2022-recap %}). This includes the new Apache Ignite
connector we talked about in the [Trino Community Broadcast episode
46]({{site.url}}/episodes/46.html). At Trino Fest we are going to share some
more exciting news about new connectors and integrations for Trino. Specifically
on the client tooling side you can expect some great demos and news from the
Python community.

So what are you waiting for? It's time to register for the event. And if you
think you also want to share your knowledge and usage of Trino, submit a speaker
proposal.

forward to have you at the event.
