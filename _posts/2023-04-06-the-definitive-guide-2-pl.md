At this stage Trino is used all around the globe as we know from the [community
chat]({{ site.url }}/slack.html) and [our speakers at Trino Summit 2022]({%
post_url 2022-11-21-trino-summit-2022-recap %}). One large community of Trino
contributors and maintainers, many employed by [Starburst](http://starburst.io),
is located in Poland. Poland also has a very active participation of developers
and users in the Java and Big Data communities.
