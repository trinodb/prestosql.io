Join us to discover how as part of their customer data platform, Arm Treasure
Data utilizes Presto as the query engine processing over 1 million queries per
day. This system supports the data business of over 500 companies in three
regions - US, EU, and Asia. 

Arm Treasure Data has been using Presto 0.205 and in 2019 started a big
migration project to Presto 317. Although they performed extensive query
simulations to check any incompatibilities, the team faced many unexpected challenges.
In this session you learn more about their migration of the production system:

* Technical details on many challenges
* Key lessons learned
* Latest updates on AWS Graviton2, the next generation of 64-bit Arm instance
  types that can be used for running Presto

Our speaker, Taro L. Saito, is a principal software engineer at Arm Treasure
Data and Ph.D. of computer science at the University of Tokyo. He has built a
cloud database service at Arm Treasure Data, which is processing over millions
of queries every day. Previously, he worked as an assistant professor at the
University of Tokyo, studying distributed database systems and their
applications to genome sciences. He has created several open-source projects,
including Airframe, MessagePack, and various sbt plugins (sbt-sonatype,
sbt-pack) for Scala that help to publish thousands of OSS projects.
