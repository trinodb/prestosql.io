Trino, Trino, Trino everywhere. Just looking at our website stats and the users
in our community chat, we know that Trino is going places. We also know that one
of these places with a large user community is China. And now we have good news
for you. A translation of the second edition of the book to Chinese is now
available.

Today, we are happy to announce that a Chinese translation of the book [Trino:
The Definitive Guide]({{ site.url }}/trino-the-definitive-guide.html) is now
available for the communities all across China and far beyond and hopefully a
lowers the barrier to Trino for native speakers. We invite you all to get your
own copy:

Our thanks goes out the teams at O'Reilly and dangdang for making this happen.
