It‚Äôs inspiring and mindblowing to reflect on the ten year journey that has
produced the community around Trino. Trino is the community-driven fork from
Presto, the distributed big data SQL query engine created at Facebook in 2012. We
are a community of engineers, scientists, analysts, and visionaries that work in
a fast paced world where the expectations on the time to insights from our
analytics and the scale of the data are ever-increasing. Sometimes words only do
so much justice to encompass a journey like this one, so we created a video to
let you experience it yourself! Enjoy!

As we watch the video and think back to the five years Presto and Trino shared,
you begin to appreciate the organic development of the community, and the
excitement around the solution space that the project brought to big data. As a
baseline, Trino offers a faster and more interactive alternative to accessing
data stored in HDFS via Hive. But the project didn‚Äôt stop there. Development of
the SPI abstracted metadata and storage access to different
systems, making Trino a suitable engine to query an entire data ecosystem from
one location using ANSI SQL! Since the projects split, Trino has skyrocketed in
development from the original project and added an array of features that
we‚Äôve listed out in the [evolution of the Trino architecture blog post]({% post_url 2022-08-04-decade-innovation %}).

To really celebrate this milestone, we wanted to offer some exciting ways for
you to learn more about Trino, and spin up Trino on your own system to play
around with it. We have a list of blogs, project stats, and ways to get involved
below. Starburst is also celebrating by offering free Trino birthday t-shirts
when you
