In the third part of our training series [Learning SQL with Trino from the
experts]({% post_url 2023-09-27-training-series %}) David Phillips and I changed
gears from reading data and performing analytics with Trino. We looked the the
topic of write operations. We covered creating catalogs, schema, tables, and
then inserting and updating data, and talked about related topics such as data
source and connector support.
