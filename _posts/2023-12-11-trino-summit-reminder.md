questions for you all to puzzle over, and are ready to reward your fast and
correct answers.

Cole Bowden and I will guide you through the two days of the event as hosts. The
chat on the event platform as well as the Trino slack channel for the event will
allow you to talk to other community members and the presenters, ask questions,
and follow up for more answers and discussions.

We will announce the winning entries for our SQL routine competition and look a
bit at the implementation. And if you are keen to write one, there is still have
time to share your best SQL routine. You might be among the winners.
