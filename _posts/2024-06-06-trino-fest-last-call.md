This week has surely started off with a big bang and another boom in the data
platform world. Snowflake [introduced the open source Polaris
catalog](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/introducing-polaris-catalog/) as
implementation of the Iceberg REST catalog specification. And Databricks, the
main driver of the Delta Lake table format, [announced their acquisition of
Tabular](https://www.databricks.com/blog/databricks-tabular), a main driver in
the Apache Iceberg community.

Interestingly enough, Trino is in the middle of all this with great support for
Delta Lake, Hudi, Iceberg, and also the Iceberg REST catalog. And if all that
interoperability with Trino is not enough reason to join us next week at Trino
Fest 2024, I have some more ideas for you to consider.

## Reasons to attend Trino Fest

Trino Fest is happening next week on the 13th of June, and following are all the
reasons I can think of why you should tune in.

* The event is free for all attendees. It is available as an in-person event in
  Boston and for virtual attendance across the rest of the world.
* You can learn about real world experience with Trino, Delta Lake, Iceberg,
  Hudi, and many [other data sources, clients, and add-ons]({{site.url}}/ecosystem/index.html).
* Many Trino friends, users, and contributors from around the world and
  companies like Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, character.ai, Dune, LanceDB,
  Microsoft, Onehouse and Starburst are going to attend and present.
* Monica Miller and Manfred Moser will guide you through the event with the help
  of the awesome Starburst Trino events team.
* In-person attendees might just meet our mascot, Commander Bun Bun.
* On the following day, the [Trino Contributor
  Congregation](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/wiki/Contributor-meetings#trino-contributor-congregation-14-june-2024)
  will dive super deep into technical details and collaborative efforts.
