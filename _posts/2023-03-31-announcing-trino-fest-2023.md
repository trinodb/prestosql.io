Get ready to kick off your summer with Commander Bun Bun at Trino Fest 2023!
This year's event is going virtual and will take place over two days, 14th
and 15th of June. The focus of the event will be on Trino as a data lakehouse query
engine, with discussions on new features and the ecosystem around Trino to
support better data lakehouse management.

Trino Fest 2023 is the new annual summer event dedicated to all things Trino.
Building on the success of last year’s [Cinco de Trino]
({% post_url 2022-05-17-cinco-de-trino-recap %}), we’re excited to bring the
community together once again to explore the latest trends and innovations in
Trino and data lakehouse management. With a focus on education, community
collaboration, and inspiration, Trino Fest 2023 will be a valuable experience
for anyone interested in improving their data and analytics platform. We hope to
see you there as attendee, speaker, or sponsor! Read below to find out how to

## What's new this year?

Aside from the new title, this year's Trino Fest will differ from last years,
short conference in a few ways. We're featuring more talks from Trino
practitioners, the event will run over two shorter days to avoid the death march
of talks, and there will be more summer, lakehouse, and camping puns. Of course,
there will be continued use of the [Trinoritaville song
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfJ63DNbAuI&list=PLFnr63che7wYFsknFAqisURvfm96rW0Dr&index=4).
Whether you're just getting started with Trino or you're a seasoned pro, there
will be something for everyone at Trino Fest.

## What is Trino Fest versus Trino Summit

Trino was [built from the beginning to query on Hive data]({% post_url
2020-10-20-intro-to-hive-connector %}), so Trino moving on to support a data
lakehouse is simply the evolution from its flagship use case. Trino Fest covers
the latest features and improvements to Trino that make it an even better choice
for data lakehouse management. You'll hear from speakers who are using Trino in
innovative ways, and who can provide valuable insights and tips for managing
your own data lakehouse. Going with the chill summer theme, there will be plenty
of time to have fun and relax too!
