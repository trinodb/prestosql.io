Sometimes when working in the depth of the query engine core, the planner, the
optimizer, or some other tricky problem or code, you run out of steam and need a
distraction. Your brain will quietly work on the problem in the background while
you get to read or do something interesting.

During one break we found out more about GPT-3 and the recent improvements on
the OpenAI project. So we had to try.

It's pretty amazing that you can feed the AI a prompt just like we did:

```
Write a short rhyming poem explaining Trino in easy but accurate terms
```

And after a few trials, the best one produced by GPT-3 was this:

```
Trino is a tech platform,
That makes data integration a breeze,
It's designed to help your business grow,
And optimise your systems with ease.
It links together different sources,
Both big and small,
Gathers data of different types,
Helping you make decisions for all.
So Trino is an integration tool,
That connects data for you,
It'll ease the burden of data sync,
Giving you more time to do what you do.
```

Cool, huh? Have a look at another prompt:

```
Write a short rhyming poem explaining Trino, the SQL query engine in complex
and accurate terms.
```

And the compelling result:

```
Trino is a query engine that does more than just run,
It’s a SQL engine with performance that stuns.
It is secure, efficient, and kind,
Providing real-time analytics of any kind.
It’s a distributed system that’s built to scale,
Processing queries that never fail.
Connecting to myriad data sources,
It can quickly analyze any course.
It’s flexible, reliable, and fast,
And is designed to make your queries last.
It can handle large volumes of data with ease,
Making the most complex queries a breeze.
```

Enjoy while we are heading back to [working on Trino pull
requests](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pulls) and other code now.
