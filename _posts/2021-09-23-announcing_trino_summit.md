Greetings Trino nation,

Get ready for this year's virtual Trino Summit event! This year's summit feels a
little different as the name of the event has changed from Presto to Trino. So
this will be the first event of the project hosted [under the new banner of Trino](https://trino.io/blog/2020/12/27/announcing-trino.html).

This year's Summit is hosted by Starburst virtually on October 21st and 22nd.  We'd originally set the date on September 15th but later realized that this was conflicting with Yom Kippur. While we had originally set out to make this event a hybrid format, we had to make the difficult decision of moving the event to fully virtual in lieu of the growing health concerns around contracting and spreading the delta variant. If you haven't registered yet, [register here](http://starburst.io/trinosummit2021). If you planned on attending in person, we will still have your registration and you will still be able to attend virtually.

Get excited for our great lineup of speakers, panels, and presentations! We're always on the lookout for speakers who are excited to share their Trino experiences.

We look forward to seeing you there!
