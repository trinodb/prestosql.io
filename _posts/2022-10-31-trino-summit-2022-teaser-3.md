Lets dive right into the five reasons you should attend Trino Summit 2022. If
you're not into these lists, go ahead and 
[register now](https://www.starburst.io/info/trinosummit/)!

### 1. Hear speakers from industry leading companies talk about their Trino architecture and use cases

This year's summit contains leaders in the industry with varying workloads and
use cases. There are also sessions on tips and tricks to scale and lower the
cost of running Trino in production. Users from the following companies speak
about their challenges and how they use Trino to help overcome them:

* Apple
* Astronomer
* Bloomberg
* Comcast
* Goldman Sachs
* Lyft
* Quora
* Shopify
* SK Telecom
* Starburst
* Upsolver
* Zillow

To see more information about the talks and the agenda for the conference, check
out the [Trino Summit 2022 agenda](https://www.starburst.io/info/trinosummit#agenda).

### 2. Meet the authors of the ***Trino: The Definitive Guide*** and get that Trino swag

This year, we are giving away autographed copies of the recently updated,
[__Trino: The Definitive Guide__](
{% post_url 2022-10-03-the-definitive-guide-2 %}) to members who are attending.
Already have a physical copy? Visit the Trino booth to get your book signed and
meet authors 
[Manfred Moser](https://twitter.com/simpligility),
[Matt Fuller](https://twitter.com/mfullertweets), and
[Martin Traverso](https://twitter.com/mtraverso) who literally wrote the book on
Trino.

</p>

We will be giving away swag packs containing an autographed copy of Trino: The
Definitive Guide, a Trino Summit 2022 shirt, a Commander Bun Bun plushie, and 
more to both virtual and in-person attendees! This will be done during our
sponsored giveaway breaks between sessions where we challenge both online and 
virtual attendees in a race against time to bag the swag! 

### 3. Federate 'em all

This year's summit will be a free event that federates both data and humans. The
theme extends from a popular show that many of you know called Pok√©mon. To
understand the connection here, let's break down what we mean by federate 'em
all. In the same way Pok√©mon protagonist, Ash Ketchum, catches and trains
heterogeneous creatures called Pok√©mon, Trino queries and filters heterogeneous
data sets from various data sources. 

If you're not familiar with Pok√©mon, a losing strategy is to train just one or
two Pok√©mon as different types of Pok√©mon are better suited to different tasks.
In the same way, centralizing all of your data to a single data warehouse or
data lake doesn't make sense either. There are different use cases and 
different needs across the company. Rather than spending your time building
brittle one-size-fits-all architectures, Trino enables you to connect to
[multiple data sources]({{site.url}}/docs/current/connector.html) using ANSI SQL.

### 4. Experience beautiful San Francisco

For those attending in-person, you will get to enjoy the beautiful San Francisco
area. The [Commonwealth club](https://www.starburst.io/info/trinosummit/#location),
is located right on the San Francisco Bay. The building is beautiful with a
large auditorium for the main event, and plenty of floors and rooms for socializing.

At the end of the summit, we will have a happy hour on the scenic roof-deck that
gazes over the San Francisco bay at the iconic Oakland Bay Bridge.

</p>

We know this only applies to our in-person attendees, but remember if you join
us virtually, there are still plenty of resources to network and interact 
throughout the conference. We will be taking questions from our virtual audience
and there will also be a chat forum to discuss with attendees from across the
globe. Plus, unlike those of us attending in-person, no travel is required and
pajamas are optional during the event!

### 5. Collaborate with some of the best minds working on Trino

Trino is a relatively new paradigm compared to the rest of data world. If you
just realized that you don't have to move all your data into one location,
you're on the right track. However, there's still a lot to learn when it comes
to scaling out a query engine that over time grows in usage. To get this right,
you need a community to be successful. The creators Martin, Dain, and David and
many of the core contributors of Trino will be attending, along with a large
list of folks that are using multiple clusters over hundreds of petabytes of
data.

Tap into this incredibly passionate group of Trino enthusiasts to augment your
experience with this revolutionary query engine!

## Announcing the final round of sessions and the agenda!

Now for the final list of sessions to announce for this year's Trino Summit!
This week is quite the reveal as we are showcasing a talk of how engineers at
Apple use Trino for their analytics challenges! üéâü§Ø 

We also have three more amazing guests that are heavy hitters in the data and
analytics tech scene.

### Trino at Apple

In this talk the audience will learn how Apple uses Trino to accelerate
analytics, the challenges we face deploying analytics at scale at Apple, and the
areas we would like to collaborate on with the community.

* *Vinitha Gankidi, Software engineer at Apple*

* *Yathindranath Peddyshetty, Software engineer at Apple*

### Enterprise ready Trino at Bloomberg: One Giant Leap Toward Data Mesh!

Enterprises like Bloomberg love Trino. It allows us to embrace the data mesh
with ease. Providing Trino as a service in a highly available, configurable, and
access-controlled manner has been a key enabler for us in this paradigm shift.
Join us to learn how we have leveraged open-source components to achieve these
goals at Bloomberg.

* *Pablo Arteaga, Software Engineer at Bloomberg*

* *Vishal Jadhav, Software Engineer at Bloomberg*

### Leveraging Trino to power data quality at Goldman Sachs

Data is at the core of today's business processes. We are responsible for making
accurate, timely, and modeled data available to our analytics and application
teams. The source of these datasets can be quite heterogeneous like HDFS, S3,
Sybase, Snowflake, Elasticsearch, and more. Also with an increase in data
volume, velocity, and variety; data quality assurance is extremely critical to
ensure the trustworthiness of data and mark it usable for consumers to use with
confidence. We have leveraged Trino to make high-quality data centrally
accessible through an efficient, secure, governed, and unified way of performing
analytics.

* *Sumit Halder, Vice President at Goldman Sachs*

* *Ramesh Bhanan, Vice President at Goldman Sachs*

* *Siddhant Chadha, Associate at Goldman Sachs*

* *Suman Baliganahalli Narayan Murthy, Vice President at Goldman Sachs*

### Scaling Trino at Zillow

Trino is a critical tool used at Zillow for doing analytics on datalake. In this
talk we aim to give a general overview of how we leverage Trino and dive deeper
into the optimizations we have done for scaling Trino at Zillow using Spot
instances.

In this session, we will show how fault-tolerant execution mode enables a more
cost-effective and resilient execution running Trino on Spot.

* *Rupesh Kumar Perugu, Senior Software Engineer at Zillow*

* *Santhosh Venkatraman, Software Engineer at Zillow*

That finalizes all of our sessions! To see them all, check out the
[Trino Summit 2022 agenda](https://www.starburst.io/info/trinosummit#agenda).
