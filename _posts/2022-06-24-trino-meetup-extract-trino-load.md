This past week, [Andrii Rosa](https://github.com/arhimondr) hosted a virtual
Trino meetup on the topic of using Trino as a batch processing engine. You can
view the talk from the meetup embedded below. Andrii dives into the history of
Trino as an engine for Batch ETL (extract, transform, load) processing, some
challenges related to that, as well as the new fault-toleration execution
capabilities being added to Trino and how they improve it for Batch ETL use
cases.
