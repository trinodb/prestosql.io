Later in December your knowledge of our Trino SQL query engine will certainly
peak again at [Trino Summit 2024]({% post_url
2024-07-11-trino-summit-2024-call-for-speakers %}). To reach those heights and
absorb all there is to learn at Trino Summit, you need to get ready.

That is why I teamed up with our [Trino creators and
BDFLs]({{site.baseurl}}/development/roles#benevolent-dictators-for-life-) --
Martin Traverso, Dain Sundstrom, and David Phillips. We aim to be your coaches
and trainers to get you ready and get to the summit without the need for oxygen
masks and sherpas. Join us for the **"SQL basecamps before Trino Summit"**,
where we expand on our [past SQL training
series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnvSBYhRZLg&list=PLFnr63che7wYzZoo5yyEF5R1QrOH6VRq3)
with two new episodes.

Both planned sessions provide a high-level overview and some practical tips and
tricks over the course of an hour. The sessions are completed by an open
questions and answers section with the speakers.

## Moving supplies

In the first episode **SQL basecamp 1 – Moving supplies** David and Dain will
help me provide an overview of the wide range of possibilities when it comes to
moving data to Trino and moving data with Trino. 

We specifically look at the strengths of Trino for running your data lakehouse
and migrating to it from legacy data lakes or other systems. SQL skills
discussed include tips for creating schemas and tables, adding and updating
data, and inspecting metadata. We talk about table procedures for data
management and also cover some operational aspects. For example, we talk about
the right configuration in your catalogs for your object storage, specifically
the new file system support in Trino.

## Getting ready to summit

The second episode **SQL Basecamp 2 – Getting ready to summit** builds on the
foundation established in episode 1. Data has moved into the lakehouse, powered
by Trino, and more data is added and changed as part of normal operation. In
this episode Martin and myself look at maintaining the data in a healthy state
and explore some tips and tricks for querying data. For example, we look at data
management with procedures, analyzing data with window functions, and examine
more complex structural data.

## What do want to learn

So there you have it - enough reason to register. Well, if not we can do better:
Both sessions are aimed at all of you out there using Trino and we are ready to
discuss your questions during class. More importantly though, I would also love
to hear your suggestions for these and other topics about SQL and Trino. We can
adjust this series, figure out a session for Trino Summit, or bring another SQL
training series to you next year.
