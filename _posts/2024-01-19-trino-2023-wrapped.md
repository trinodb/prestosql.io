If [‚ÄúWrapped‚Äù is good enough for Spotify](https://www.newsroom.spotify.com/2023-wrapped/), 
it‚Äôs good enough for Trino, right? As we look forward to a bright 2024, we can
also take a moment to get sentimental, look back at everything we‚Äôve
accomplished, and reflect on the progress we‚Äôve made. Commander Bun Bun has been
hard at work, so if you haven‚Äôt been paying close attention to Trino or want an
idea of all that went down in 2023, we‚Äôre happy to present you with an end of
year recap. We‚Äôll be exploring what‚Äôs gone on in the community, on development,
the events we‚Äôve hosted, and discuss the cool new features and technologies you
can use when you‚Äôre running Trino.

- Slack usage picked up dramatically
- YouTube viewership was up 7% despite a lack of Pokemon-themed musical content compared to 2022 (our bad)
- 30 releases kept new versions of Trino coming out more than every other week.

Thanks in part to all that growth, it‚Äôs more important than ever to be on
[our Slack](/slack.html). If you‚Äôre a Trino user or community member and aren‚Äôt
already on there, you‚Äôre missing out! Make sure to join up for community
announcements, release statuses, the shared expertise of the entire Trino
community, and event-specific channels for discussion when we‚Äôre hosting things 
like Trino Fest and Trino Summit. Speaking of those‚Ä¶

## Trino events

One of the best parts of being an open source community is that it's easy to be
excited and connect with others about using such a cool piece of technology.
Whether that's bringing Trino to new users who can take advantage of it, or
sharing our learnings with other Trino users to make the most, events are one of
the best ways to distribute that knowledge. So what were we up to this year?

### Trino Fest and Trino Summit

[Trino Fest]({{site.url}}{% post_url 2023-06-20-trino-fest-2023-recap %}) and
[Trino Summit]({{site.url}}{% post_url 2023-12-18-trino-summit-recap %}) are
becoming mainstays on the Trino calendar each year, and 2023 was no different.
Formerly ‚ÄúCinco de Trino,‚Äù we ditched the Cinco de Mayo theme and went with the
simpler ‚ÄúTrino Fest‚Äù in June, opting to theme it around Commander Bun Bun‚Äôs Lake
House Summer Camp, with a focus on integrating Trino with lakehouse and data
lake architectures. Trino Summit only wrapped up a little over a month ago,
rounding out the year and highlighting some amazing developments that we‚Äôll be
talking about later in this blog post.

Trino Fest has historically been the smaller event, but it did some catching up
in 2023, as both Trino Fest and Trino Summit were made virtual and expanded to 2
days this year. Easier to attend than ever before, we reached a combined total
of about 1,200 live attendees, with thousands more views on demand.

The lineups were packed with 34 talks across both events, featuring speakers
from huge Trino users like Salesforce, Stripe, Apple, and Lyft, as well as from
major Trino contributors like Starburst, Tabular, and Bloomberg. You can
view [recordings of every Trino Fest talk](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFnr63che7wbBu_czq-SS9iVdQ4CIv2z1)
and [every Trino Summit talk](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFnr63che7wYeJLUjUaEftCFfjymhgLcq)
on the Trino YouTube channel if you missed out.

### Meetups and international events

One of the more exciting developments was our a major event in Japan -
[Trino Conference Tokyo]({{site.url}}{% post_url 2023-10-11-a-report-about-trino-conference-tokyo-2023 %}). 
A virtual event with four sessions, it brought Trino to a Japanese-speaking
audience and further pushed our favorite query engine across language borders.
On top of that,
[Starburst co-hosted a Trino meetup in Bengaluru](https://www.starburst.io/info/india-trino-meetup-miq/?utm_source=trino&utm_medium=slack&utm_campaign=APAC-FY24-Q4-CM-india-Meetup-at-MiQ-Digital), 
and the community organized the first-ever Korean Trino meetup (pictured below).

And last but not least,
[Trino, the Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition](/trino-the-definitive-guide.html)
was translated into Mandarin and Polish.

## The Trino Gateway

One of the biggest announcements in the Trino community this year was
the [launch of the Trino Gateway]({{site.url}}{% post_url
2023-09-28-trino-gateway %}). A proxy and
load-balancer, it‚Äôs a crucial piece of Trino infrastructure for organizations
that need more than one Trino cluster to suit their needs.

Why would you want more than one Trino cluster? Maybe you want one cluster with
fault-tolerant execution enabled for ETL workloads and another cluster for
speedy ad-hoc analytics. Perhaps you have analysts performing wildly
differently-sized queries, and high-volume compute-intensive queries are proving
to be bad neighbors for lightweight and low-latency queries that shouldn‚Äôt take
more than milliseconds. Historically, users would have to manually manage
swapping between clusters, establish a new connection, and try not to get a
headache in the process.

Enter the Trino Gateway! By routing all of your Trino traffic automatically,
it‚Äôs never been easier to manage, maintain, and query multiple Trino clusters at
once. Load balancing ensures that no one cluster gets overworked, and it‚Äôs the
perfect way to stop large queries from getting in the way of the little guys.
Add in the fact that you can seamlessly shut down an individual cluster for
updates or maintenance while the Trino Gateway routes traffic elsewhere, and
it‚Äôs easy to see why this is such a game-changer. We‚Äôre super excited for it to
be out there in the world, and we hope it makes running Trino at the largest
scales simpler and faster than ever before.

## New features

With more development on Trino than ever before, there were obviously a ton of
new things being added to it. Let's go over some of the biggest adds in 2023.

### SQL routines

Whether you want to refer to them as SQL routines or as user-defined functions,
they‚Äôre a big deal. Fresh off the presses and only a few months old, they do
exactly what you‚Äôd expect them to do: you, a user, can define and re-use your
own functions! Define and use them inline as part of a query to make that query
cleaner, easier, and simpler to understand. Or, if you‚Äôre really cooking, you
can run a query that defines the routine in the schema of the catalog. This
allows other Trino users to access the same routine time and time again as part
of their other queries. It‚Äôs a level of customization that we‚Äôve never had
before in Trino, and no longer do you need to write your own Java plugins to
create and re-use functions that do exactly what you need them to do.

If you want to learn more about SQL routines, you can check
out [the introduction to SQL routines](/docs/current/routines/introduction.html)
in our documentation, as well as
[a video from our SQL training series]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1siAYR6BzzY&list=PLFnr63che7wYzZoo5yyEF5R1QrOH6VRq3&index=4)
and a few [example routines](/docs/current/routines/examples.html) which give a
good look at how they can be used.

### Schema evolution and dynamic catalogs

While we‚Äôre providing more power, customization, and flexibility to Trino users,
it‚Äôs also important to highlight just how much has been added this year to make
it easier to adjust things on the fly.

Schema evolution in Hive was a big addition, allowing you to alter columns‚Äô data
types, rename columns, and handle nested fields when dropping columns. Instead
of needing to use the underlying database or modify it some other way and reboot
Trino, Trino can handle the adjustments on the fly.

But if you don't use Hive and are feeling left out, we‚Äôve experimentally taken
things one step further in 2023, adding dynamic catalogs to Trino. Rather than
adjusting your schema one column at a time, what about adding or dropping an
entire catalog in one go? You can do that now. Though it‚Äôs currently still
bleeding-edge and not ready for widespread use on your important production
data sources, we‚Äôre looking forward to improving it and making it resilient and
stable in 2024.

### Project Hummingbird

Trino has always been about squeezing out every ounce of performance that you
can get. Check out our [release notes](/docs/current/release.html) and
you‚Äôll see that every version includes at least a couple performance
improvements. Over time, these performance improvements add up to a substantial
gain, meaning that version-over-version, year-over-year, Trino is always getting
faster. Project Hummingbird was a concerted effort this year to take a look at
the core engine and make a number of architectural changes paired with small
improvements that would add up to something very substantial.
[The GitHub issue tracking it](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/14237)
lists a ton of work that's been accomplished already, with a lot of that work
done in 2023. Though stay tuned for more, because that's only scratching the
surface...

### Lakehouse improvements

Want to leverage the historical log of all actions taken on a table in Hudi? The
new `$timeline` system table has you covered. How about in Delta Lake? We‚Äôve got
the `table_changes` function for that, and views were added there, too. Too many
metadata tables to list were added to Iceberg, along with the REST, JDBC, and
Nessie catalogs for metadata.

### Java 21!

Java 21. It‚Äôs required to run version Trino versions 436 and later. With
[the upgrade from Java 17 to 21]({{site.url}}{% post_url 2023-11-03-java-21 %})
comes a ton of improvements that will make development on Trino easier and
better than ever, which will in turn make it faster and smoother than ever.
Though not as huge of a deal as our upgrade to Java 17 last year, expect to see
the benefits coming down the pipeline as the engineers working on Trino are able
to take advantage of the latest and greatest features in Java.

## Trino ecosystem updates

There's more to Trino than Trino itself! With community updates and other
technologies integrating with Trino, the number of ways you can access and use
Trino are always growing. And the number of people taking care of Trino is
growing, too.

### Python clients

Trino‚Äôs own [Python client](https://github.com/trinodb/trino-python-client) saw
heavy development in 2023. It was updated to support SQLAlchemy 2.0 and had type
support fully fleshed out, making it a robust, free, and open-source tool for
running your Trino queries.

Elsewhere in the Python ecosystem, we heard from
both [Fugue](https://youtu.be/aKhI1Phfn-o)
and [Ibis](https://youtu.be/JMUtPl-cMRc) at Trino Fest, two different Python
clients that integrate Trino with Python in new ways. Fugue is a wrapper that
helps integrate with other Python tools and clients, and Ibis can help convert
your Python code into SQL queries, making it feasible to be a 100% Python-based
organization that still leverages the speed and power of a SQL query engine like
Trino. We had Phillip Cloud from Voltron Data on
for [an episode of the Trino Community Broadcast](/episodes/49) to talk about
Ibis in even more detail.

### And other clients, too!

Also on the Trino Community Broadcast repping new client support for Trino in
2023 were [Dolphin Scheduler](/episodes/45), [PopSQL](/episodes/51),
and [Coginiti](/episodes/53). Dolphin Scheduler is a workflow orchestrator - and
scheduler! - that can be used to routinely run and coordinate Trino queries.
PopSQL is like Google Drive for SQL, providing a suite of collaborative tools
for editing and working on queries as a team, including synchronous query
editing, storing query history, and a robust commenting and feedback system.
Coginiti is a high-powered data workspace that connects to Trino among many
other things, supporting a host of powerful features that make it easier to
reuse code and snippets of queries, as well as featuring embedded variables to
minimize redundancy. If you want to learn more about any of these clients, click
in on the links above to check out the Trino Community Broadcast where we went
in-depth with them!

Oh, and don‚Äôt forget
the [Trino Typescript client](https://regadas.dev/trino-js-client/), for when
you want to work at the beautiful intersection of web development and accessing
tons of data.

### New maintainers

Trino saw three new maintainers added to its ranks this year:

- [Manfred Moser](https://github.com/mosabua)
- [James Petty](https://github.com/pettyjamesm)
- [Mateusz Gajewski](https://github.com/wendigo)

Manfred even took the liberty of updating the website‚Äôs
[roles page](/development/roles) to list out all our maintainers. Thank you to
them for their dedication to making Trino the best it can be, and
congratulations to them on their shiny maintainer titles!

## Conclusion
