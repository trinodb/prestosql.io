Do you have a rough idea of what SQL is? Do you need to get data out of object
storage in the cloud and some relational database at the same time? You should
look at Trino and learn about SQL.

Or do you know the ins and outs of joins, window functions, and your SQL
queries are counted by the pages and not lines? You may even be the expert on SQL on
your team. You should *also* look at Trino and SQL.

Luckily for you all, we have the right SQL training for everyone in our upcoming
series with the founders of the Trino project and SQL experts Martin Traverso,
Dain Sundstrom, and David Phillips, and myself as host and co-trainer.

In the SQL training series, we start with the basics of Trino. You will learn
that despite the fact that there is leopard frog on the cover of [Trino: The
Definitive Guide]({{site.baserurl}}/trino-the-definitive-guide.html), SQL does
not stand for Silly Quacking Leopardfrogs. Instead SQL stands for Structured
Query Language, and you will learn about the benefits of connecting [many
data sources]({{site_url}}/ecosystem/index.html#data-sources) to Trino, and using
[different clients]({{site_url}}/ecosystem/index.html#clients). And you can always use
the same powerful SQL. And for the SQL pros, you learn about catalogs and
queries that go across data sources.

Then we'll glance at the basic SQL foundations, since there are literally
hundreds of books, videos, and training course around. All of them teach you
things like `SELECT` statements, and `WHERE` clauses, and unravel the confusions
around `LEFT OUTER JOIN` and the like.

And after this is when we get to the interesting stuff. Following is a list of
some of the topics we will cover:

* Trino concepts like cluster, data source, client, catalog, and more
* Overview of all the SQL support with statements, data types, functions, and
  connector support
* Working with data types, including numerical and text values, dates and times,
  JSON, ...
* Lots of scalar, aggregation, window functions
* Object storage and other data sources
* Creating schemas, tables, and views
* Inserting, merging, moving and deleting data
* Metadata in general and in hidden tables like `$properties`
* Table procedures
* Trino views, Trino materialized views and other views
* Global and connector level table functions, including query pass-through
* Support for SQL routines, also known as user-defined functions

Interested now? No matter how great your SQL knowledge or Trino expertise is,
you will learn something new in this series.  So what are you waiting for?
