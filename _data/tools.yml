    Apache Superset enables users to consume data in many different ways:
    writing SQL queries, creating new tables, creating a visualization
    (slice), adding that visualization to one or many dashboards and
    downloading a CSV. SQL Lab is a a part of Superset and provides a rich
    SQL editor that enables users to both query and visualize data. You
    can explore and preview tables in Trino, effortlessly compose SQL
    queries to access data. From there, you can either export a CSV file
    or immediately visualize your data in the Superset "Explore" view.
